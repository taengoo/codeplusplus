      </div>

      <h3 class="section-header">ADDING ENEMIES</h3>
      <p>A space shooter isn’t any fun without enemies, so next you will add some enemies into the game<br />
by creating an Enemy sprite class. Although there will be multiple types of enemies, they are all<br />
represented by the same class and differentiated only by different templates for their image and<br />
movement.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Calculating Enemy Movement</h3>
      <p>You define the movement for enemies with an equation that contains a few pluggable parameters<br />
that enable enemies to exhibit relatively complex behavior without a lot of code. The equation sets<br />
the velocity of an enemy at a given time since it was added to the board:<br />
<br />
vx = A + B * sin(C * t + D)<br />
vy = E + F * sin(G * t + H)<br />
<br />
All the letters A through H represent constant numbers. Don’t let these equations intimidate you.<br />
All they say is that the velocity of an enemy is based on a constant value plus a value that repeats<br />
cyclically. (Using a sine enables the cyclical value.) Using an equation such as this allows the game<br />
to add enemies that twirl around the screen in interesting patterns and adds some dynamism to<br />
the game that a bunch of enemies flying in a straight line wouldn’t. Sines and cosines are used<br />
often in game development for animation because they provide a mechanism for smooth movement<br />
transitions. See Table 2.1 for a description of the effect each parameter A–H has on the<br />
movement of an enemy.<br />
<br />
NOTE Parabolas created with quadratic equations ( a + bx + cx*x ) are also useful<br />
for this but don't provide periodic behavior, so they aren’t quite as useful in<br />
this situation.<br />
<br />
TABLE 2-1: Parameter Descriptions<br />
PARAMETER DESCRIPTION<br />
A Constant horizontal velocity<br />
B Strength of horizontal sinusoidal velocity<br />
C Period of horizontal sinusoidal velocity<br />
D Time shift of horizontal sinusoidal velocity<br />
E Constant vertical velocity<br />
F Strength of vertical sinusoidal velocity<br />
G Period of vertical sinusoidal velocity<br />
<br />
A number of different combinations of values produce different behaviors. If B and F are set to zero,<br />
then the enemy flies straight because the sinusoidal component in both directions is zero. If F and A<br />
are set to zero, then the enemy flies with a constant y velocity but moves back and forth smoothly in<br />
the x direction.<br />
<br />
You create a variety of different enemies in the section “Setting Up the Enemies” by setting different<br />
variations of parameters.<br />
<br />
In a production game, if you don’t want to worry about handling the math yourself, you could consider<br />
using a tweening engine such as TweenJS (www.createjs.com/TweenJS), which can handle<br />
smoothly moving objects from one position to another in a number of interesting manners.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Constructing the Enemy Object</h3>
      <p>You can create enemies from a blueprint that sets the sprite image used, the initial starting location,<br />
and the values for the movement of constants A–H. The constructor also enables an override object<br />
to be passed in to override the default blueprint settings.<br />
<br />
Much like PlayerMissile, the Enemy object adds methods onto the prototype to speed object creation<br />
and reduce the memory footprint.<br />
<br />
This initial version of Enemy looks much like the previous two sprite classes that have been built<br />
(PlayerShip and PlayerMissile), with a constructor function shown in in Listing 2-2 that initializes<br />
some state; a step method that updates the position and checks if the sprite is out of bounds;<br />
and a draw function that renders the sprite. Because of the need to copy over from the blueprint and<br />
any override parameters and set up the velocity equation parameters, the constructor function is a<br />
little more complicated than previous ones.<br />
<br />
JavaScript doesn’t have a built-in method to easily copy attributes over from another object, so you<br />
need to roll your own loop over the attributes to do it. To prevent the need for the blueprint to set<br />
each of the parameters A–H, each of those are also be initialized to zero.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-2: The Enemy Constructor
var Enemy = function(blueprint,override) {
  var baseParameters = { 
    A: 0, B: 0, C: 0, D: 0,
    E: 0, F: 0, G: 0, H: 0 
  }

  // Set all the base parameters to 0
  for (var prop in baseParameters) {
    this[prop] = baseParameters[prop];
  }

  // Copy of all the attributes from the blueprint
  for (prop in blueprint) {
    this[prop] = blueprint[prop];
  }

  // Copy of all the attributes from the override, if present
  if(override) {
    for (prop in override) {
      this[prop] = override[prop];
    }
  }

  this.w = SpriteSheet.map[this.sprite].w;
  this.h = SpriteSheet.map[this.sprite].h;
  this.t = 0;
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>The constructor first copies three sets of objects into the this object: the base parameters, the blueprint,<br />
and the override. Because the enemy can have different sprites depending on the blueprint,<br />
the width and the height are set afterward based on the sprite property of the object. Finally, a<br />
t parameter is initialized to 0 to keep track of how long this sprite has been alive.<br />
If the repetition in this code bothers you, don’t worry! You clean it up in the section “Refactoring<br />
the Sprite Classes” later in this chapter.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Stepping and Drawing the Enemy Object</h3>
      <p>The step function (see Listing 2-3) for the enemy should update the velocity based on the aforementioned<br />
equation. The this.t property needs to be incremented by dt to keep track of how long the<br />
sprite has been alive. Next, the equation from earlier in this chapter can be plugged directly into the<br />
step function to calculate the x and y velocity. From the x and y velocity, the x and y location are<br />
updated. Finally, the sprite needs to check if it’s gone off the board to the right or the left, in which<br />
case the enemy can remove itself from the page.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-3: The Enemy Step and Draw Methods
Enemy.prototype.step = function(dt) {
  this.t += dt;
  this.vx = this.A + this.B * Math.sin(this.C * this.t + this.D);
  this.vy = this.E + this.F * Math.sin(this.G * this.t + this.H);
  this.x += this.vx * dt;
  this.y += this.vy * dt;

  if(this.y > Game.height ||
     this.x < -this.w ||
     this.x > Game.width) {
    this.board.remove(this);
  }
}
Enemy.prototype.draw = function(ctx) {
  SpriteSheet.draw(ctx,this.sprite,this.x,this.y);
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>The draw function is a near duplicate of the PlayerMissile object; the only difference is that it<br />
must look up which sprite to draw in a property called sprite.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Adding Enemies on the Board</h3>
      <p>Now you add some initial enemy sprites to the top of game.js along with a simple enemy blueprint<br />
for one enemy that can fly down the page:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var sprites = {
  ship: { sx: 0, sy: 0, w: 37, h: 42, frames: 1 },
  missile: { sx: 0, sy: 30, w: 2, h: 10, frames: 1 },
  enemy_purple: { sx: 37, sy: 0, w: 42, h: 43, frames: 1 },
  enemy_bee: { sx: 79, sy: 0, w: 37, h: 43, frames: 1 },
  enemy_ship: { sx: 116, sy: 0, w: 42, h: 43, frames: 1 },
  enemy_circle: { sx: 158, sy: 0, w: 32, h: 33, frames: 1 }
};

var enemies = {
  basic: { x: 100, y: -50, sprite: 'enemy_purple', B: 100, C: 2 , E: 100 }
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Next, modify playGame to add a pair of enemies to the top of the page:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var playGame = function() {
  var board = new GameBoard();

  board.add(new Enemy(enemies.basic));
  board.add(new Enemy(enemies.basic, { x: 200 }));
  board.add(new PlayerShip());

  Game.setBoard(3,board);
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Using the enemies object as a blueprint for the enemy makes adding an enemy onto the page as<br />
simple as calling new Enemy() with that blueprint. To make the second enemy appear to the right of<br />
the first, an override object is passed in setting x to 200.<br />
<br />
Reload the file, and when the game starts, you should have a couple of bad guys snake their way<br />
down the screen and then disappear off the bottom. You can also take a look at http://mh5gd.<br />
com/ch2/enemies to see the effect this code has. These enemies aren’t doing any collision detection,<br />
so they won’t interact with the player.<br />
<br />
The basic enemy has only three of the enemy movement parameters defined: B (horizontal sinusoidal<br />
movement), C (horizontal sinusoidal period), and E (vertical fixed movement). Play with these<br />
parameters to affect the movement. Increasing C, for example, increases the frequency with which<br />
the enemies bounce back and forth.<br />

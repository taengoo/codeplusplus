      <h3 class="section-header">REFACTORING THE SPRITE CLASSES</h3>
      <p>At this point the game has three different sprite classes that all share a lot of the same boilerplate<br />
code. This means it’s time to apply the Rule of Three.<br />
<br />
As described by Wikipedia, the rule is:<br />
<br />
Rule of three is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece<br />
of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that the code can be copied<br />
once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted<br />
into a new procedure. The rule was introduced by Martin Fowler in Refactoring and<br />
attributed to Don Roberts.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)<br />
<br />
Even though Alien Invasion is a one-off game engine that isn’t intended to be turned into a generalpurpose<br />
engine, it still pays to put in a little bit of time to refactor the code when it makes sense to<br />
clean up any rampant duplication and make the game easier to fix and extend.<br />
<br />
No one writes perfect code the first time, especially when prototyping and trying out new features.<br />
When that code works, however, failing to refactor and clean up code during development leads<br />
to technical debt. The more technical debt you have on a project, the more painful it is to make<br />
changes and add new features. Refactoring can clean up technical debt by removing unused code,<br />
reducing code duplication, and cleaning up abstractions, all things that don’t make your game better<br />
necessarily but make your life as a game developer better.<br />
<br />
In Alien Invasion, the main culprits of duplication in these three sprite classes are the boilerplate<br />
setup code and the draw method, which is the same across all three methods. It’s time to extract<br />
those into a base object called Sprite, which can handle initialization given a set of setup parameters<br />
as well as a sprite to use. Inside the Enemy constructor, the three loops to copy one object into<br />
another is also a good opportunity for refactoring.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t done a lot of prototypical inheritance in JavaScript, the syntax may look strange.<br />
Because JavaScript doesn’t have the idea of classes, instead of defining a class that represents the<br />
inherited properties, you create a prototype object where JavaScript will look when a parameter isn’t<br />
defined on the actual object.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Creating a Generic Sprite Class</h3>
      <p>In this section you create the Sprite object that all other sprites inherit from. Open up engine.js<br />
and add the following code shown in Listing 2-4:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-4: A Generic Sprite Object
var Sprite = function() { }

Sprite.prototype.setup = function(sprite,props) {
  this.sprite = sprite;
  this.merge(props);
  this.frame = this.frame || 0;
  this.w = SpriteSheet.map[sprite].w;
  this.h = SpriteSheet.map[sprite].h;
}

Sprite.prototype.merge = function(props) {
  if(props) {
    for (var prop in props) {
      this[prop] = props[prop];
    }
  }
}

Sprite.prototype.draw = function(ctx) {
  SpriteSheet.draw(ctx,this.sprite,this.x,this.y,this.frame);
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>This code goes into engine.js because it’s generic engine code versus game-specific code. The constructor<br />
function is empty because each sprite has its own constructor function, and the Sprite<br />
object is created only once for each of the descendant sprite object definitions. Constructor functions<br />
in JavaScript don’t work the same as constructors in other OO languages such as C++. To get<br />
around this, you need a separate setup function to be called explicitly in the descendant objects.<br />
<br />
This setup method takes in the name of the sprite in the SpriteSheet and a properties object. The<br />
sprite is saved in the object, and then properties are copied over into the Sprite. The width and<br />
height are also set here as well.<br />
<br />
Because copying over properties into an object is such a common need, Sprite also defines a merge<br />
method that does just that. This method is used in the setup method.<br />
<br />
Finally, the draw method, which is nearly identical in every sprite so far, can be defined once here<br />
and then will be available in every other sprite.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Refactoring PlayerShip</h3>
      <p>Armed with the Sprite class, the PlayerShip object can be refactored to simplify setup. The new<br />
code is marked in bold in Listing 2-5:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-5: A Refactored PlayerShip
var PlayerShip = function() {
  this.setup('ship', { vx: 0, frame: 1, reloadTime: 0.25, maxVel: 200 });
  this.reload = this.reloadTime;
  this.x = Game.width/2 - this.w / 2;
  this.y = Game.height - 10 - this.h;

  this.step = function(dt) {
    if(Game.keys['left']) { 
      this.vx = -this.maxVel; 
    } else if(Game.keys['right']) { 
      this.vx = this.maxVel; 
    } else { 
      this.vx = 0; 
    }

    this.x += this.vx * dt;

    if(this.x < 0) { 
      this.x = 0; 
    } else if(this.x > Game.width - this.w) {
      this.x = Game.width - this.w
    }

    this.reload-=dt;

    if(Game.keys['fire'] && this.reload < 0) {
      this.reload = this.reloadTime;
      this.board.add(new PlayerMissile(this.x,this.y+this.h/2));
      this.board.add(new PlayerMissile(this.x+this.w,this.y+this.h/2));
    }
  }
}

PlayerShip.prototype = new Sprite();
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>At the top of the constructor function, the setup method is called, wiping out some boilerplate<br />
code. A few of the properties are set when setup is called, but a few are set afterward because they<br />
depend on the values of the other properties such as the object’s width and height, which isn’t available<br />
until after setup is called. Next, the draw method is removed because it is handled by Sprite.<br />
<br />
Finally, the code to actually set up PlayerShip’s prototype comes after the PlayerShip constructor<br />
function is defined.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Refactoring PlayerMissile</h3>
      <p>The PlayerMissile object was already compact, but refactoring helps make it even shorter. See<br />
Listing 2-6.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-6: Refactored PlayerMissile
var PlayerMissile = function(x,y) {
  this.setup('missile',{ vy: -700 });
  this.x = x - this.w/2;
  this.y = y - this.h;
};

PlayerMissile.prototype = new Sprite();
PlayerMissile.prototype.step = function(dt) {
  this.y += this.vy * dt;
  
  if(this.y < -this.h) { 
    this.board.remove(this); 
  }
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>The constructor method still needs to explicitly set the x and y location because these are dependent on<br />
the width and height of the sprite (which aren’t available until after setup is called). The step method<br />
is unaffected by the refactoring, and the draw method can be removed as it’s handled by Sprite.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Refactoring Enemy</h3>
      <p>The Enemy object benefits the most from the refactoring, particularly in the constructor method.<br />
Instead of using a number of loops to copy parameters into the object, a few calls to merge simplify<br />
the method down to three lines. See Listing 2-7.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-7: Refactored Enemy Object (Partial Code)
var Enemy = function(blueprint,override) {
  this.merge(this.baseParameters);
  this.setup(blueprint.sprite,blueprint);
  this.merge(override);
}

Enemy.prototype = new Sprite();
Enemy.prototype.baseParameters = { 
  A: 0, B: 0, C: 0, D: 0,
  E: 0, F: 0, G: 0, H: 0,
  t: 0 
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>The step method is unaffected (and so isn't shown in Listing 2-7) and the draw method can be<br />
removed. Notice that merge is called explicitly to merge in the set of baseParameters and the<br />
override parameters. The predefined baseParameters object is also pulled out of the constructor<br />
and put into the prototype. Although not a huge optimization, it prevents the need for the static<br />
baseParameters object to be re-created each time a new Enemy is created just for the sake of being<br />
copied over into the object. Because baseParameters isn’t going to be modified, one copy of the<br />
object will do.<br />
</p>

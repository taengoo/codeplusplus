      </div>

      <h3 class="section-header">CREATING THE GAMEBOARD OBJECT</h3>
      <p>The first step to turning Alien Invasion into a game is to add a mechanism that handles a<br />
bunch of sprites on the page at the same time. The current Game object can handle a stack of<br />
boards, but those boards all act independently of each other. Also, although the Game object<br />
provides a mechanism to swap boards in and out, it doesn't make it easy to add an arbitrary<br />
number of sprites onto the page. Enter the GameBoard object.<br />
</p>
    
      <h3 class="section-header">Understanding the GameBoard</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the GameBoard object is much like the game board in a game of checkers. It provides<br />
a spot to drop all the pieces and dictates their movement. In this section you break down some of<br />
the responsibilities of this object. The responsibilities of the GameBoard can be broken down into<br />
four distinct categories:<br />
- It is responsible for keeping a list of objects and handling adding sprites to and removing<br />
sprites from that list.<br />
- It also needs to handle looping over that list of objects.<br />
- It needs to respond the same way as previous boards. It needs to have a step and a draw<br />
function that calls the appropriate functions on each of the objects in the object list.<br />
- It needs to handle checking of collisions between objects.<br />
<br />
The next few sections walk through each of the parts of the GameBoard object, which will behave<br />
like a simple scene graph. Scene graphs are discussed in detail in Chapter 12, “Building Games with<br />
CSS3.” The GameBoard class will be added to the bottom of the engine.js file.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Adding and Removing Objects</h3>
      <p>The first and most important responsibility of the GameBoard class is to keep track of the objects in<br />
play. The easiest way to keep track of a list of objects is simply to use an array, in this case an array<br />
called objects.<br />
<br />
The GameBoard class will be described piecemeal, but the whole thing goes at the bottom of the<br />
engine.js file:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var GameBoard = function() {
  var board = this;
  // The current list of objects
  this.objects = [];
  this.cnt = [];
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>This array is where objects that show up in the game are added to and removed from.<br />
Next, the class needs the capability to add objects. This is simple enough. Pushing objects onto the<br />
end of the objects’ list gets most of the job done:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Add a new object to the object list
this.add = function(obj) {
  obj.board = this;

  this.objects.push(obj);
  this.cnt[obj.type] = (this.cnt[obj.type] || 0) + 1;

  return obj;
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>For an object to interact with other objects, however, it needs access to the board it’s a part of. For<br />
this reason when GameBoard.add is called, the board sets a property called board on the object.<br />
The object can now access the board to add additional objects, such as projectiles or explosions, or<br />
remove itself when it dies.<br />
<br />
The board also must keep a count of the number of objects of different types that are active at a<br />
given time, so the second-to-last line of the function initializes the count to zero if necessary using a<br />
boolean OR and then increments that count by 1. Objects won’t be assigned types until later in this<br />
chapter, so this is a little bit of forward-looking code.<br />
<br />
Next is removal. This process is slightly more complicated than it first might seem because objects<br />
may want to remove themselves or other objects in the middle of a step while the GameBoard loops<br />
over the list of objects. A naive implementation would try to update GameBoard.objects but<br />
because the GameBoard would be in the middle of looping over all the objects, changing them midloop<br />
would cause problems with the looping code.<br />
<br />
One option is to make a copy of the list of objects at the beginning of each frame, but this could get<br />
costly to do each frame. The best solution is to first mark objects for removal in a separate array and<br />
then actually remove them from the object list after every object has had its turn. Following is the<br />
solution GameBoard uses:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Mark an object for removal
this.remove = function(obj) {
	var wasStillAlive = this.removed.indexOf(obj) != -1;

	if(wasStillAlive) { 
		this.removed.push(obj); 
	}

	return wasStillAlive;
};

// Reset the list of removed objects
this.resetRemoved = function() { 
	this.removed = []; 
}

// Remove objects marked for removal from the list
this.finalizeRemoved = function() {
	for(var i=0,len=this.removed.length;i < len;i++) {
		var idx = this.objects.indexOf(this.removed[i]);

		if(idx != -1) {
			this.cnt[this.removed[i].type]--;
			this.objects.splice(idx,1);
		}
	}
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>At the beginning of each step, resetRemoved is called to reset the list of objects to be removed.<br />
The remove method first checks if an object has already been removed and then adds it to the list of<br />
objects to remove only if it’s not already there. It then returns true if the object was added or false<br />
if the object was already dead. After every object has its turn, finalizeRemoved is called. This<br />
method finds the removed objects in the objects list using Array.indexOf and then uses the Array<br />
.splice method to cut those objects out of the list. When an object is removed from the list, it is<br />
effectively dead because it no longer has its step and draw methods called.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Iterating over the List of Objects</h3>
      <p>Because much of what GameBoard does is iterate over a list of objects, it stands to reason that<br />
a couple of helper methods to make that easier would come in handy. Two main methods are<br />
needed. First, a simple iterate method that calls the same function on every object in the object list<br />
is useful for the step and draw methods. Second, a detect method that returns the first object for<br />
which a passed-in function returns true makes collision detection easier. Both of these methods<br />
are listed here:<br />
<br />
First up is iterate:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Call the same method on all current objects
this.iterate = function(funcName) {
	var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,1);
	for(var i=0,len=this.objects.length;i < len;i++) {
		var obj = this.objects[i];
		obj[funcName].apply(obj,args)
	}
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Although the meat of the function is just a loop over this.objects, the method does have a couple<br />
of interesting JavaScript features.<br />
<br />
The first line of the method is a well-known JavaScript hack. The arguments object, which is available<br />
in every method call, contains a list of the arguments passed into that method and is used by<br />
methods that accept varying numbers of arguments. arguments acts in many ways like an array, but<br />
it’s not an actual array. This is a shame because in this case you’d like to get all the arguments out<br />
except for the first, which is the funcName, so that they can be passed on to the function to be called<br />
on every object. arguments doesn’t have the slice method, but because JavaScript enables you to<br />
take methods and apply them to whatever object you like using call or apply, the line<br />
<br />
var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,1);<br />
<br />
can do just that and turn the arguments object into a proper array starting at the second element.<br />
Inside of the loop the code looks up the method in the object’s properties using the square bracket<br />
operator and then calls apply to call that method with whatever the passed in arguments are.<br />
Next is the detect method, which will be used later for collision detection. Its job is to run the same<br />
function on all of a board’s objects and return the first object that the function returns true for. In<br />
the abstract this doesn’t seem all that useful, but if you need to do collision detection or find a specific<br />
object based on certain parameters, the detect method is useful.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Find the first object for which func is true
this.detect = function(func) {
	for(var i = 0,val=null, len=this.objects.length; i < len; i++) {
		if(func.call(this.objects[i])) return this.objects[i];
	}

	return false;
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>detect consists of a loop over the objects and a call to the passed-in function with the object passed<br />
in as the this context. If that function returns true, then the object is returned; otherwise, the<br />
functions returns false after it runs out of objects to compare against.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Defining the Board Methods</h3>
      <p>Next are the standard board functions, step and draw. Using the methods already defined, these<br />
functions have trivial definitions:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Call step on all objects and then delete
// any objects that have been marked for removal
this.step = function(dt) {
	this.resetRemoved();
	this.iterate('step',dt);
	this.finalizeRemoved();
};

// Draw all the objects
this.draw= function(ctx) {
	this.iterate('draw',ctx);
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Both step and draw use the iterate method to call a specifically named function on each object in<br />
the list, with step also making sure to reset and finalize the list of removed items.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Handling Collisions</h3>
      <p>The last bit of functionality in the purview of GameBoard is the handling of collisions. Alien<br />
Invasion uses a simplified collision model that reduces each of the sprites on the board to a simple<br />
rectangular bounding box. If the bounding boxes of two different objects overlap, then those two<br />
sprites are deemed to be colliding. Because each sprite has an x and a y position in addition to a<br />
width and a height, this box is easy to calculate.<br />
<br />
NOTE A bounding box is the smallest rectangle that encompasses the entirety of<br />
an object. Using bounding boxes to do collision detection instead of polygons or<br />
exact pixel data is faster to calculate, but is much less accurate.<br />
<br />
GameBoard uses two functions to handle collision detection. The first, overlap, simply checks for<br />
the overlap between two objects’ bounding boxes and returns true if they intersect. The easiest way<br />
to do this detection is clever. Rather than check whether one object is in the other, you simply need<br />
to check if one object couldn’t be in the other and negate the result.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
this.overlap = function(o1,o2) {
	return !((o1.y+o1.h-1 < o2.y) || (o1.y > o2.y+o2.h-1) || (o1.x+o1.w-1 < o2.x) || (o1.x > o2.x+o2.w-1));
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>What’s going on here is that the bottom edge of object one is checked against the bottom edge<br />
of object two to see if object one is to the right of object two. Next, the top edge of object one is<br />
checked against the bottom edge of object two and so on through each of the corresponding edges.<br />
If any of these are true, you know object one doesn’t overlap object two. By simply negating the<br />
result of this detection, you can tell if the two objects overlap.<br />
<br />
With a function in your pocket to determine overlap, it becomes easy to check one object against all<br />
the other objects in the list.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
this.collide = function(obj,type) {
	return this.detect(function() {
		if(obj != this) {
			var col = (!type || this.type & type) && board.overlap(obj,this)
			return col ? this : false;
		}
	});
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Collide uses the detect function to match the passed-in object against all the other objects and<br />
returns the first object for which overlap returns true. The only complication is the support for an<br />
optional type parameter. The idea behind this is that different types of objects want to collide with<br />
only certain objects. Enemies, for example, don’t want to collide with themselves, but they do want<br />
to collide with the player and the player’s missiles. By doing a bitwise AND operation, collisions<br />
against objects of multiple types can be performed without the loss of speed that an array or hash<br />
lookup would require. One caveat is that each of the different types must be a power of two to prevent<br />
overlap of different types.<br />
<br />
For example, if types were defined as the following:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var OBJECT_PLAYER = 1,
	OBJECT_PLAYER_PROJECTILE = 2,
	OBJECT_ENEMY = 4,
	OBJECT_ENEMY_PROJECTILE = 8;
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>an enemy could check if it collides with a player or a player’s missile by doing a bitwise OR of the<br />
two types together:<br />
<br />
board.collide(enemy, OBJECT_PLAYER | OBJECT_PLAYER_PROJECTILE)<br />
<br />
Objects can also be assigned multiple types, and the collide function would still work as planned.<br />
With that, the GameBoard class is complete. See gameboard/engine.js for the full version of the<br />
object in the code for this chapter.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Adding GameBoard into the Game</h3>
      <p>With the GameBoard class complete, the next step is to add it into the game. A quick modification of<br />
the playGame function from game.js does the trick:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var playGame = function() {
	var board = new GameBoard();
	board.add(new PlayerShip());
	Game.setBoard(3,board);
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Reload the index.html file, and you should see exactly the same behavior as at the end of Chapter 1.<br />
All that’s been done is to have the GameBoard take over managing the ship sprite. This is less than<br />
impressive because so far the game isn’t putting the GameBoard class to good use because it just has<br />
a single sprite in it. This is remedied in the next section.<br />
</p>

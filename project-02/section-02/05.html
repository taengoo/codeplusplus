      <h3 class="section-header">HANDLING COLLISIONS</h3>
      <p>Alien Invasion is slowly coming together. It now has a player, missiles, and enemies flying around<br />
the screen. Unfortunately, none of these pieces are interacting by blowing each other up as is<br />
expected in a save-the-planet-from-destruction shooter game.<br />
The good news is that the majority of the hard work for handling collisions has already been done.<br />
The GameBoard object already knows how to take two objects and figure out if they are overlapping<br />
as well as determine if one object is colliding with any others of a specific type. All that’s necessary<br />
now is to add the appropriate calls to those collision functions.<br />
For collisions, Alien Invasion can use two mechanisms. The first is to do proactive checks in every<br />
object’s step function against any objects it has an interaction with. The second would be to have<br />
a general collision phase where objects trigger collision events when they hit each other. The former<br />
is simpler to implement, whereas the latter offers better overall performance and can be better optimized.<br />
Alien Invasion is going to go the simpler route, but the platformer game built in Chapter 18,<br />
“Creating a 2-D Platformer,” uses the more complicated mechanism.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="javascript">Adding Object Types</h3>
      <p>To ensure that objects collide only with objects that it makes sense for them to collide with, objects<br />
need to be assigned types. This was discussed at the beginning of the chapter but has not yet been<br />
implemented in the game. The first step is to determine the different object types the game has and<br />
add some constants to keep from having to use magic numbers in the code.<br />
<br />
Add the code from Listing 2-8 to the top of game.js to define five different types of objects.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-8: Object Types
var OBJECT_PLAYER = 1,
    OBJECT_PLAYER_PROJECTILE = 2,
    OBJECT_ENEMY = 4,
    OBJECT_ENEMY_PROJECTILE = 8,
    OBJECT_POWERUP = 16;
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>NOTE Each of these types shown in Listing 2-8 is a power of two, which is an<br />
efficiency optimization to enable the use of bitwise logic as discussed earlier.<br />
<br />
Next, add three lines to game.js setting the type of each Sprite at an appropriate spot after each<br />
Sprite’s prototype assignment code:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
PlayerShip.prototype = new Sprite();
PlayerShip.prototype.type = OBJECT_PLAYER;
...
PlayerMissile.prototype = new Sprite();
PlayerMissile.prototype.type = OBJECT_PLAYER_PROJECTILE;
...
Enemy.prototype = new Sprite();
Enemy.prototype.type = OBJECT_ENEMY;
Each object now has a type that can be used for collision detection.
      </code>
      </pre>

      <h3 class="section-header">Colliding Missiles with Enemies</h3>
      <p>To prevent duplicated effort, instead of objects checking for collisions with every type of object<br />
they might hit, objects check only against objects that they actually “want” to hit. This means that<br />
PlayerMissile objects check if they are colliding with Enemy objects, but Enemy objects won’t<br />
check if they are colliding with PlayerMissile objects. Doing so keeps the number of calculations<br />
down a little bit.<br />
<br />
Now that objects can be hit, they need to have a method to deal with what should happen when<br />
they are hit. To begin with, add a method to Sprite that removes an object whenever it gets hit.<br />
This method can be overridden down the road by the various inherited objects.<br />
<br />
Add the following function to the bottom of engine.js below the rest of the Sprite object definition:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
Sprite.prototype.hit = function(damage) {
  this.board.remove(this);
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>This initial version of the hit method just removes the object from the board, regardless of the<br />
amount of damage done.<br />
<br />
Add a damage value to the PlayerMissile constructor function:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var PlayerMissile = function(x,y) {
  this.setup('missile',{ vy: -700, damage: 10 });
  this.x = x - this.w/2;
  this.y = y - this.h;
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Next, open up game.js, and edit the PlayerMissile step method to check for collisions:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
PlayerMissile.prototype.step = function(dt) {
  this.y += this.vy * dt;
  var collision = this.board.collide(this,OBJECT_ENEMY);

  if(collision) {
    collision.hit(this.damage);
    this.board.remove(this);
  } else if(this.y < -this.h) {
    this.board.remove(this);
  }
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>The missile checks to see if it’s colliding with any OBJECT_ENEMY type objects and then calls the<br />
hit method on whatever object it collides with. It then removes itself from the board because its<br />
job is done.<br />
<br />
Fire up the game, and you should be able to shoot down the two enemies flying down the screen.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Colliding Enemies with the Player</h3>
      <p>To make it a fair fight, enemies need to have the ability to take down the player as well when they<br />
make contact.<br />
<br />
Adding essentially the same chunk of code to the Enemy step method allows the Enemy to take out<br />
the player. Modify the step method to read as follows:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
Enemy.prototype.step = function(dt) {
  this.t += dt;
  this.vx = this.A + this.B * Math.sin(this.C * this.t + this.D);
  this.vy = this.E + this.F * Math.sin(this.G * this.t + this.H);
  this.x += this.vx * dt;
  this.y += this.vy * dt;

  var collision = this.board.collide(this,OBJECT_PLAYER);

  if (collision) {
    collision.hit(this.damage);
    this.board.remove(this);
  }

  if (this.y > Game.height || this.x < -this.w || this.x > Game.width) {
    this.board.remove(this);
  }
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>This code is identical to the code added to the PlayerMissile object except that it calls collide<br />
with an OBJECT_PLAYER object type.<br />
<br />
After making those changes, fire up the game and let your player be taken out by one of the ships.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Making It Go Boom</h3>
      <p>So far the collisions have the correct effect; however, there’s something to be said for a more dramatic<br />
effect to liven things up. The sprites.png file has a nice explosion animation in there for just that<br />
reason. The explosion image was generated using the explosion generator on http://www.positech<br />
.co.uk/.<br />
<br />
Add the sprite definition to the top of game.js for the explosion:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var sprites = {
  ship: { 
    sx: 0, sy: 0, w: 37, h: 42, frames: 1 
  },
  missile: { 
    sx: 0, sy: 30, w: 2, h: 10, frames: 1 
  },
  enemy_purple: { 
    sx: 37, sy: 0, w: 42, h: 43, frames: 1 
  },
  enemy_bee: { 
    sx: 79, sy: 0, w: 37, h: 43, frames: 1 
  },
  enemy_ship: { 
    sx: 116, sy: 0, w: 42, h: 43, frames: 1 
  },
  enemy_circle: { 
    sx: 158, sy: 0, w: 32, h: 33, frames: 1 
  },
  explosion: { 
    sx: 0, sy: 64, w: 64, h: 64, frames: 12 
  }
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Now add some health to the blueprint for a basic enemy:<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
var enemies = {
  basic: { 
    x: 100, y: -50, sprite: 'enemy_purple',
    B: 100, C: 4, E: 100, health: 20 
  }
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Next, you need to override the default hit method from Sprite for the Enemy object. This method<br />
needs to reduce the health of the Enemy, so check if the Enemy has run out of health; if so add an<br />
explosion to the GameBoard at the center of the Enemy, as shown in Listing 2-9.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-9: Enemy Hit Method
Enemy.prototype.hit = function(damage) {
  this.health -= damage;

  if(this.health <=0) {
    if(this.board.remove(this)) {
      this.board.add(new Explosion(
        this.x + this.w/2,
        this.y + this.h/2
      ));
    }
  }
}
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Finally, the Explosion class needs to be built. The class is a basic sprite that when added onto the<br />
page just flips itself through its frames and then removes itself from the board. See Listing 2-10.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 2-10: The Explosion Object
var Explosion = function(centerX,centerY) {
  this.setup('explosion', { frame: 0 });
  this.x = centerX - this.w/2;
  this.y = centerY - this.h/2;
  this.subFrame = 0;
};

Explosion.prototype = new Sprite();
Explosion.prototype.step = function(dt) {
  this.frame = Math.floor(this.subFrame++ / 3);

  if (this.subFrame >= 36) {
    this.board.remove(this);
  }
};
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>The Explosion constructor method takes the passed in centerX and centerY position and adjusts<br />
the x and y location by moving the sprite half of its width to the left and half the height up. The<br />
step method doesn’t need to worry about moving the explosion each frame; it just needs to update<br />
the subFrame property to cycle through each of the frames of the explosion animation. Each frame<br />
of the explosion animation plays for three game frames to make it last a little bit longer. When all<br />
36 subFrames of the explosion have played through (12 actual frames), the Explosion removes<br />
itself from the board.<br />
<br />
Reload the game, and try to take out the enemies flying down the screen. It should take two missiles<br />
to take out an enemy now, but that enemy should explode in a nice fiery blast.<br />

      <h3 class="section-header">BUILDING A COMPLETE GAME IN 500 LINES</h3>
      <p>
To drive home the point of how easy it is to build games in HTML5, the final game you build in the<br />
first three chapters contains fewer than 500 lines of code, all without using any libraries.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Understanding the Game</h3>
      <p>
Alien Invasion is a top-down 2-D shooter game built in the spirit of the game 1942 (but in space) or<br />
a simplified version of Galaga. The player controls a ship, shown at the bottom of the screen, flying<br />
the ship vertically through an endless space field while defending Earth against an incoming hoard<br />
of aliens.<br />
<br />
When played on a mobile device, control is via left and right arrows shown on the bottom left of the<br />
screen, and a Fire button on the right. When played on the desktop, the user can use the keyboard’s<br />
arrow keys to fly and the spacebar to fire.<br />
<br />
To compensate for all the different screen sizes of mobile devices, the game resizes the play area to<br />
always play at the size of the device. On the desktop it plays in a rectangular area in the middle of<br />
the browser page.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Structuring the Game</h3>
      <p>
Nearly every game of this type consists of a few of the same pieces: some asset loading, a title<br />
screen, sprites, user input, collision detection, and a game loop to tie it all together.<br />
<br />
The game uses as few formal structures as possible. Instead of building explicit classes, you take<br />
advantage of JavaScript’s dynamic typing (more on this in the section “Building Object-Oriented<br />
JavaScript”). Languages such as C, C++, and Java are called “strongly typed” because you need to<br />
be very explicit about the type of parameters that you pass around to method. This means you need<br />
to explicitly define base classes and interfaces when you want to pass different types of objects to<br />
the same method. JavaScript is weakly (or dynamically) typed because the language doesn’t enforce<br />
the types of parameters. This means you define your objects more loosely, adding methods to each<br />
object as needed, without building a bunch of base classes or interfaces.<br />
<br />
Image asset handling is dead simple. You load a single image, called a sprite sheet, that contains all<br />
your game’s sprite images in a single PNG and execute a callback after that image loads. The game<br />
also has a single method for drawing a sprite onto your canvas.<br />
<br />
The title screen renders a sprite for the main title and shows the same animated starfield from the<br />
main game moving in the background.<br />
<br />
The game loop is also simple. You have an object that you can treat as the current scene, and you<br />
can tell that scene to update itself and then to draw itself. This is a simple abstraction that works for<br />
both title and end game screens as well as the main part of the game.<br />
<br />
User input can use a few event listeners for keyboard input and a few “zones” on your canvas to detect<br />
touch input. You can use the HTML standard method addEventListener to support both of these.<br />
<br />
Lastly, for collision detection, you punt the hard stuff and just loop over the bounding boxes of each<br />
of the objects to detect a collision. This is a slow and naive way to implement collision detection,<br />
but it’s simple to implement and works reasonably well as long as the number of sprites you check<br />
against is small.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">The Final Game</h3>
      <p>
To get a sense of where the game is headed, check out Figure 1-1,<br />
and visit http://cykod.github.com/AlienInvasion/ on both<br />
a desktop browser and whatever mobile device you have handy.<br />
The game should run on any smartphone that supports HTML5<br />
canvas; however, canvas performance on Android versions<br />
before Ice Cream Sandwich is poor.<br />
<br />
Now, it’s time to get started.<br />

      <p>
Are you crying out for something more interesting than boilerplate setup code? Here’s the good<br />
news: From here on it gets much more interesting. Start by adding an animated starfield onto the<br />
page to give the game some space-like qualities.<br />
<br />
You can create a scrolling starfield in a few ways, but in this case you need to be a little careful with<br />
the number of objects that get drawn on the screen because drawing too many sprites per frame<br />
slows down the game on mobile devices. One way around this is to create an offscreen canvas buffer,<br />
draw a bunch of random stars on that buffer, and then simply draw that starfield moving slowly<br />
down the canvas. You’ll be limited to a few different layers of moving stars, but this effect should be<br />
good enough for a retro shooter.<br />
      </p>

      <div class="panel panel-code-text">
		<div class="panel-heading">THE VAGARIES OF HTML5 PERFORMANCE</div>
        <div class="panel-body">

<p>The performance question isn’t straightforward. One of the truisms of HTML5 is<br />
that you never know what method has better performance without trying it out.<br />
When deciding which way to implement a feature, your best bet is to go right to<br />
the source: Test it out! You can see the performance for different numbers of stars<br />
and ways to draw starfields at http://jsperf.com/prerendered-starfield.<br />
JSPerf.com is a great place to test your intuition. To see the results of the starfield<br />
test, scroll down the page and hit “Run Tests” to see the performance of the different<br />
runs. In this case, the answer isn't so cut and dry. Most desktops do better<br />
drawing individual stars, whereas iOS mobiles do better drawing the offscreen<br />
buffer, at the time of this writing at least. As canvas will get better hardware<br />
acceleration across the board in the near future, it seems like a safe bet that the<br />
fillrate limited offscreen buffer (as described in this section) will be substantially<br />
faster in the months and years to come.<br />
</p>

      <p>
Now break down a few of the necessary pieces before looking at the class as a whole. (You can skip<br />
to the end of the section to see the full class if you want to peek ahead.)<br />
<br />
The StarField class needs to do three main things. The first is to create an offscreen canvas. This<br />
is actually quite easy because canvas is just a regular DOM element with two attributes, width and<br />
height, and can be created the same way as any other DOM elements:<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
var stars = document.createElement(&quot;canvas&quot;);

stars.width = Game.width;
stars.height = Game.height;

var starCtx = stars.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
Because the stars field needs to be the same size as the game’s canvas, you can set the size by pulling<br />
out the width and height properties that were set in the Game.initialize method.<br />
<br />
After you create the canvas, you can start drawing stars (or rectangles) onto it. The easiest way to<br />
do this is to call fillRect once for each star that needs to be drawn. A for loop combined with<br />
using Math.random() to generate a random x and y location gets the job done:<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
starCtx.fillStyle = &quot;#FFF&quot;;
starCtx.globalAlpha = opacity;

for(var i=0;i&lt;numStars;i++) {
	starCtx.fillRect(Math.floor(Math.random()*stars.width),
	Math.floor(Math.random()*stars.height), 2, 2);
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
The only piece that hasn’t been mentioned is the globalAlpha property. This property sets the<br />
level of opacity for the canvas element. Because there are multiple layers of stars moving at different<br />
speeds, a nice effect is to have the slower stars be slightly less bright than the faster moving ones to<br />
simulate their being farther away.<br />
<br />
Next is the draw method. The Starfield needs to draw the entire canvas element containing the<br />
stars onto the game’s canvas; however, because it will scroll constantly, it needs to be drawn twice:<br />
once for the top half and once for the bottom half. The method uses the starfield’s offset, a number<br />
between zero and the height of the game to first draw whatever part of the starfield has been shifted<br />
off the bottom of the game back at the top, and then draws the bottom part.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
this.draw = function(ctx) {
	var intOffset = Math.floor(offset);
	var remaining = stars.height - intOffset;
	if(intOffset &gt; 0) {
		ctx.drawImage(stars,
			0, remaining,
			stars.width, intOffset,
			0, 0,
			stars.width, intOffset
		);
	}
	if(remaining &gt; 0) {
		ctx.drawImage(stars,
			0, 0,
			stars.width, remaining,
			0, intOffset,
			stars.width, remaining
		);
	}
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
The code looks slightly confusing because it uses the nine-parameter version of drawImage to draw<br />
the slices, but it’s actually just slicing the starfield into a top half and a bottom half, and drawing the<br />
top half at the bottom of the game canvas and the bottom half at the top of the canvas.<br />
<br />
Listing 1-7 shows the Starfield class in its entirety, which should go into the game.js file.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 1-7: The Starfield (starfield/game.js)
var Starfield = function(speed,opacity,numStars,clear) {
	// Set up the offscreen canvas
	var stars = document.createElement(&quot;canvas&quot;);
	
	stars.width = Game.width;
	stars.height = Game.height;
	
	var starCtx = stars.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);
	var offset = 0;
	
	// If the clear option is set,
	// make the background black instead of transparent
	if(clear) {
		starCtx.fillStyle = &quot;#000&quot;;
		starCtx.fillRect(0,0,stars.width,stars.height);
	}
	
	// Now draw a bunch of random 2 pixel
	// rectangles onto the offscreen canvas
	starCtx.fillStyle = &quot;#FFF&quot;;
	starCtx.globalAlpha = opacity;
	for(var i=0;i&lt;numStars;i++) {
		starCtx.fillRect(Math.floor(Math.random()*stars.width),
		Math.floor(Math.random()*stars.height), 2, 2);
	}
	
	// This method is called every frame
	// to draw the starfield onto the canvas
	this.draw = function(ctx) {
		var intOffset = Math.floor(offset);
		var remaining = stars.height - intOffset;
		// Draw the top half of the starfield
		if(intOffset &gt; 0) {
			ctx.drawImage(stars,
				0, remaining,
				stars.width, intOffset,
				0, 0,
				stars.width, intOffset
			);
		}
		
		// Draw the bottom half of the starfield
		if(remaining &gt; 0) {
			ctx.drawImage(stars,
				0, 0,
				stars.width, remaining,
				0, intOffset,
				stars.width, remaining
			);
		}
	}
	
	// This method is called to update
	// the starfield
	this.step = function(dt) {
		offset += dt * speed;
		offset = offset % stars.height;
	}
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
Only two parts haven’t been discussed. The step function at the bottom gets called with the fraction<br />
of a second that has elapsed since the last call to step. All it needs to do is update the offset<br />
variable based on the elapsed time and the speed, and then use the modulus (%) operator to make<br />
sure the offset is between zero and the height of the Starfield.<br />
<br />
There's also a conditional to check if the clear parameter is set. This parameter is used to fill the<br />
first layer of stars with a black fill. (Later layers need to be transparent so that they overlay over each<br />
other correctly.) This prevents the need to explicitly clear the canvas between frames and saves some<br />
processing time.<br />
<br />
To see the starfield in action, you need to modify your startGame function in game.js to add some<br />
starfields. Modify it to add three starfields of varying opacity by setting it to the following:<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
var startGame = function() {
	Game.setBoard(0,new Starfield(20,0.4,100,true));
	Game.setBoard(1,new Starfield(50,0.6,100));
	Game.setBoard(2,new Starfield(100,1.0,50));
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
      <p>
Only the first starfield has the clear parameter set to true. Each starfield has a higher speed combined<br />
with a higher opacity than the last. This gives an effect of stars at different distances speeding by.<br />
      </p>

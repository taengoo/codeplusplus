        <h1 class="page-title">Section 1.7</h1>
      </div>

      <h3 class="section-header">CREATING THE GAME OBJECT</h3>
      <p>
The main game object is a one-off object called, perhaps not surprisingly, Game. Its main purpose is<br />
to initialize the game engine for Alien Invasion and run the game loop as well as provide a mechanism<br />
for changing the main scene that displays.<br />
<br />
Because Alien Invasion doesn’t have an input subsystem, the Game class is also responsible for setting<br />
up listeners for keyboard and touch input. To start, only keyboard input is handled; touch input<br />
is added in the next chapter.<br />
<br />
Now that the game starts to take shape, a few additional considerations are necessary. Instead of<br />
just executing code willy-nilly when it is evaluated, it generally makes sense to wait for the page to<br />
finish downloading before initializing the game. The Game class takes this into consideration and<br />
listens for a “load” event from the window before booting up the game.<br />
<br />
The code for the Game class will be added at the top of engine.js.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Implementing the Game Object</h3>
      <p>
Now walk through the 40+ lines of code that make up the Game object a section at a time. (See the<br />
full listing at the top of game_class/engine.js in the chapter code.) The class starts off much like<br />
the SpriteSheet, as a one-time class instance:<br />
<br />
var Game = new function() {<br />
<br />
Next is the initialization routine, called with the ID of the canvas element to fill, the sprite data that<br />
is passed to the SpriteSheet, and the callback when the game is ready to start.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// Game Initialization
this.initialize = function(canvasElementId,sprite_data,callback) {
	this.canvas = document.getElementById(canvasElementId);
	this.width = this.canvas.width;
	this.height= this.canvas.height;
	
	// Set up the rendering context
	this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext &amp;&amp; this.canvas.getContext('2d');
	if(!this.ctx) { 
		return alert(&quot;Please upgrade your browser to play&quot;); 
	}
	
	// Set up input
	this.setupInput();
	
	// Start the game loop
	this.loop();
	
	// Load the sprite sheet and pass forward the callback.
	SpriteSheet.load(sprite_data,callback);
};
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
Much of this code should be familiar from earlier in the chapter. The parts where you grab the<br />
canvas element and check for a 2d context are straightforward. Next is a call to setupInput(),<br />
which is discussed next. Finally, the game loop starts, and the data for the sprite sheet passes<br />
through to SpriteSheet.load.<br />
<br />
The next section sets up input:<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// Handle Input
var KEY_CODES = { 37:'left', 39:'right', 32 :'fire' };
this.keys = {};
this.setupInput = function() {
	window.addEventListener('keydown',function(e) {
		if(KEY_CODES[event.keyCode]) {
			Game.keys[KEY_CODES[event.keyCode]] = true;
			e.preventDefault();
		}
	},false);
	window.addEventListener('keyup',function(e) {
		if(KEY_CODES[event.keyCode]) {
			Game.keys[KEY_CODES[event.keyCode]] = false;
			e.preventDefault();
		}
	},false);
};
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
      <p>
The main point of this block is to add event listeners for keydown and keyup events for those keys<br />
that you care about: specifically the left arrow, the right arrow, and the spacebar. For those events,<br />
the listeners translate a numeric Keycode to a friendlier identifier and update a hash called Game.keys<br />
to represent the current state of the user input. The player uses the Game.keys hash to control the<br />
ship. For keys used by the game, the event handlers also call e.preventDefault(), which prevents<br />
the browser from performing any default behavior in response to the key presses. (For the arrow keys<br />
and the spacebar, the browser would normally try to scroll the page.)<br />
<br />
One more point about the preceding event handler code: It uses the W3C event model<br />
addEventListener method. This code is supported in current versions of the Chrome,<br />
Safari, and Firefox browsers, but only Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 and above. This is<br />
not a huge deal because canvas isn’t supported pre-IE9 in any case, but if you want to add<br />
compatibility for older browsers, it’s something you need to be careful with. (The engine built<br />
starting in Chapter 9, “Bootstrapping the Quintus Engine Part I,” uses jQuery’s on method to<br />
enable easy browser-independent event attachment.)<br />
<br />
The last section of the Game class is relatively short:<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// Game Loop
var boards = [];
this.loop = function() {
	var dt = 30/1000;
	for(var i=0, len = boards.length;i&lt;len;i++) {
		if(boards[i]) {
			boards[i].step(dt);
			boards[i] &amp;&amp; boards[i].draw(Game.ctx);
		}
	}
	setTimeout(Game.loop,30);
};
// Change an active game board
this.setBoard = function(num,board) { boards[num] = board; };
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
The boards are the pieces of the game updated and drawn onto the canvas. An example of a board<br />
might be a background or a title screen. (In the next chapter, you create a special board for handling<br />
sprites.) The Game.loop function loops through all the boards, checks if there is a board at<br />
that index, and if so, calls that board’s step method with the approximate number of seconds that<br />
have passed, followed by calling the board’s draw method, passing in the rendering context. For the<br />
draw call, the step call may have removed the board, so checking again that the board exists with<br />
boards[i] && keeps the code from blowing up. Finally, setTimeout is used in the loop function<br />
to ensure that the loop runs again in 30 milliseconds. Using setTimout instead of setInterval<br />
ensures that timer events don’t back up if the game slows down, which could lead to strange warplike<br />
behavior. Because setTimeout doesn’t retain the context of the called function, Game.loop<br />
needs to explicitly refer to the Game object instead of using the this keyword.<br />
      </p>

	  <br>
	  
      <div class="panel panel-code-text">
		<div class="panel-heading">TIMER METHODS</div>
        <div class="panel-body">

<p>There’s more to JavaScript timers for game development than just setTimeout<br />
or setInterval. Chapter 9 discusses the requestAnimationFrame method that<br />
enables the browser to sync calls to your game with screen updates. Also, hard<br />
coding the amount of time that has passed to a fixed number is generally a bad<br />
idea as the timer may be called at different intervals depending on browser performance,<br />
but it should be okay for this simple type of game.<br />
</p>
		</div>
	  </div>

      <p>
Because boards drop from index 0 to the highest index, background boards (such as the starfield in<br />
the next section) should be added to lower indexes, whereas elements added at the end, such as the<br />
score and HUDs, should be drawn last.<br />
<br />
Finally, the only method on the Game object that is called regularly during the game, Game.setBoard, is<br />
defined. All this method does is set one of the game boards used in the loop method. It is used to switch<br />
active GameBoards, which are used for title screens as well as the main section of the game.<br />
      </p>
	  
      <h3 class="section-header">Refactoring the Game Code</h3>
      <p>
As you build games in the browser, you’ll want to keep attention on the structure of what you’re<br />
building. JavaScript is a very flexible language, and without some discipline in how your game is<br />
structured, things can fall apart quickly. A common pattern in this book will be to show you how<br />
to use an API or technique quickly and simply and then take some time to structure that code into a<br />
library or module.<br />
<br />
The initial code for displaying a sprite on the screen in game.js is going to be replaced with code<br />
that does the same but is structured in a way to be usable in a more complicated game.<br />
<br />
Update game.js to use the Game class. Remove anything you have in game.js and add the code<br />
shown in Listing 1-6.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 1-6: A refactored game.js method (game_class/game.js)
var sprites = {
	ship: { sx: 0, sy: 0, w: 18, h: 35, frames: 3 }
};

var startGame = function() {
	SpriteSheet.draw(Game.ctx,&quot;ship&quot;,100,100,1);
}

window.addEventListener(&quot;load&quot;, function() {
	Game.initialize(&quot;game&quot;,sprites,startGame);
});
	  </code>
	  </pre>

      <p>
All this code does is set up the available sprites, create a dummy startGame function that draws a<br />
ship on the canvas to make sure everything is working correctly, and then listen for the load event<br />
on the window object to call the Game.initialize function with the appropriate arguments.<br />
<br />
Reload your index.html file (or run the code example game_class/index.html) to see a lonesome<br />
ship hanging out near the canvas element.<br />
      </p>

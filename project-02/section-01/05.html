      <h3 class="section-header">CREATING YOUR GAME’S STRUCTURE</h3>
      <p>
The code built so far has been a good way to exercise the canvas capabilities you’ll be using, but it<br />
will need to be reorganized to turn it into a useful structure for a game. Now take a step back to<br />
look at some of the patterns you want to use putting together the game.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Building Object-Oriented JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
JavaScript is an object-oriented (OO) language. As such, most elements in JavaScript are objects<br />
including strings, arrays, functions and, well, objects are objects in the OO sense.<br />
<br />
But this doesn’t mean that JavaScript has all the trappings of object-oriented programming (OOP)<br />
that you might expect. First, it doesn't have a classical inheritance model. Second, it doesn't have a<br />
standard constructor mechanism, relying instead on either constructor functions or object literals.<br />
<br />
Instead of classical inheritance, JavaScript implements prototypical inheritance, meaning you can<br />
create an object that represents the prototype, or blueprint, for a set of descendant objects that all<br />
share the same base functionality.<br />
      </p>

	  <br>
	  
      <div class="panel panel-code-text">
		<div class="panel-heading">CLASSICAL VERSUS PROTOTYPICAL INHERITANCE</div>
        <div class="panel-body">

<p>Most popular object-oriented languages used today, including Java and C++,<br />
rely on classical inheritance, which means object behavior is defined by creating<br />
explicit classes and instantiating objects from those classes. JavaScript has a<br />
much more fluid method of defining classes based on the idea of prototypes, which<br />
means you create an actual object that behaves the way you want and then create<br />
child objects off of that.<br />
</p>
		</div>
	  </div>
	  
      <p>
Because methods are just regular JavaScript objects, many times developers also simply copy<br />
attributes from other objects to fake Java-style interfaces or multiple inheritance. This flexibility<br />
shouldn’t necessarily be viewed as a problem; rather, it means that developers have a lot of flexibility<br />
for how to create objects and can pick the best method for the specific use case.<br />
<br />
Alien Invasion uses constructor functions combined with prototypical inheritance where it makes<br />
sense. Using object prototypes can make object creation up to 50 times faster and provides memory<br />
savings, but it is also more restricting because you can’t use closures to access and protect data.<br />
Closures are a feature of JavaScript that allows you to keep variables in a method around for later<br />
use even when a method has finished execution.<br />
<br />
Chapter 9, “Bootstrapping the Quintus Engine: Part I,” discusses object-creation patterns in more<br />
detail, but for now just realize that the use of different methods is intentional.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Taking Advantage of Duck Typing</h3>
      <p>
There’s a famous saying that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it must be a duck.<br />
When programming in strongly-typed languages, there’s no doubt whether it’s a duck—it must be<br />
an instance of the “Duck” class, or if you program in Java, implement the iDuck interface.<br />
<br />
In JavaScript, a dynamically-typed language, parameters, and references are not type-checked,<br />
meaning you can pass any type of object as a parameter to any function, and that function happily<br />
treats that object like the type of whatever object it was expecting until something blows up.<br />
<br />
This flexibility can be both a good and a bad thing. It’s a bad thing when you end up with cryptic<br />
error messages or errors during run time. It’s a good thing when you use that flexibility to keep a<br />
shallow inheritance tree but can still share code. The idea of using objects based on their external<br />
interface rather than their type is called duck typing.<br />
<br />
Alien Invasion uses this idea in a couple of places: game screens and sprites. The game treats anything<br />
that responds to method calls of step() and draw() as valid game screen objects or valid sprites.<br />
Using duck typing for game screens enables Alien Invasion to treat title screens and in-game screens<br />
as the same type of object, making it easy to switch between levels and title screens. Similarly, using<br />
duck typing for sprites means that the game can be flexible with what can be added to a game board,<br />
including the player, enemies, projectiles, and HUD elements. HUD, which is short for Heads Up<br />
Display, is the term commonly used for elements that sit on top of the game, such as number of lives<br />
left and the player’s score.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Creating the Three Principle Objects</h3>
      <p>
The game needs three principle, mostly persistent objects: a Game object tying everything together; a<br />
SpriteSheet object for loading and drawing sprites; and a GameBoard object for displaying, updating,<br />
and handling the collision of sprite elements. The game also needs a gaggle of different sprites<br />
such as the player, enemies, missiles, and HUD objects, such as the score and number of remaining<br />
lives, but those are introduced individually later.<br />

      <h3 class="section-header">GETTING STARTED WITH CANVAS</h3>
      <p>
You hopefully noticed a canvas tag in the middle of the HTML on the page (as shown in<br />
Listing 1-2):<br />
<br />
&lt;canvas id='game' width='320' height='480'&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
<br />
This is where all the action for the game takes place&mdash;so much exciting stuff you can do in such an<br />
unassuming tag.<br />
<br />
The tag has an id for easy reference along with a width and height. Unlike most HTML elements,<br />
you generally never want to add a CSS width and height onto canvas elements. Those styles visually<br />
resize your canvas but do not affect the pixel dimensions of the canvas, which is controlled by<br />
the width and height on the element. Most of the time you should leave these alone.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <h3 class="section-header">Accessing the Context</h3>
	  <p>
Before you can do any drawing onto canvas, you need to fetch the context from the canvas element.<br />
The context is the object that you actually make API calls against (not the canvas element itself.)<br />
For 2-D canvas games, you can pull out the 2-D context, as shown in Listing 1-3.<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 1-3: Accessing the rendering context
var canvas = document.getElementById('game');

var ctx = canvas.getContext &amp;&amp; canvas.getContext('2d');
if(!ctx) {
	// No 2d context available, let the user know
	alert('Please upgrade your browser');
} else {
	startGame();
}

function startGame() {
	// Let's get to work
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
First, grab the element from the document. These initial chapters use built-in browser methods for<br />
all DOM (Document Object Model) interaction; later you are introduced to how to do the same<br />
things more concisely using jQuery.<br />
<br />
Next, call getContext on the canvas element. A double-ampersand (&amp;&amp;) short circuit operator protects<br />
you from calling a nonexistent method. This is used in the next if statement in case the visiting<br />
browser doesn&rsquo;t support the canvas element. You always want to &ldquo;fail loudly&rdquo; in this case, so<br />
the players correctly blame their browser instead of your code. &ldquo;Failing loudly&rdquo; means that instead<br />
of &ldquo;failing silently&rdquo; with a white screen and an error hiding on the JavaScript console, the game<br />
explicitly pops up with a message that tells the user that something went wrong.<br />
<br />
There is a 3-D WebGL-powered rendering context available on desktop browsers (excluding<br />
Internet Explorer), but it is called glcanval and is available only on mobile Nokia devices at the<br />
time of this writing. WebGL is another standard, separate from HTML5, that allows you to use<br />
hardware-accelerated 3-D graphics in the browser.<br />
<br />
Add the code from Listing 1-3 to a file named game.js. You now can start playing with the canvas<br />
element.<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3 class="section-header">Drawing on Canvas</h3>
	  <p>
This initial tutorial doesn&rsquo;t use any of the vector-based drawing routines, but for the sake of getting<br />
something up on the screen quickly, you can draw a rectangle on the page. Modify the startGame()<br />
method of your game.js file to read as follows:<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
function startGame() {
	ctx.fillStyle = '#FFFF00';
	ctx.fillRect(50,100,380,400);
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
To draw a filled rectangle, you use the fillRect method on the ctx object, but first you need to set<br />
a fill style. You can pass in standard CSS color representations as strings to fillStyle, including<br />
hexadecimal colors, RGB triples, or RGBA quads.<br />
<br />
To layer a semitransparent rectangle on top of the existing one, add the following:<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
function startGame() {
	ctx.fillStyle = '#FFFF00';
	ctx.fillRect(50,100,380,400);
	// Second, semi-transparent blue rectangle
	ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0,0,128,0.5);';
	ctx.fillRect(0,50,380,400);
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>

	  <p>
If you add the preceding code and reload your index.html file, you see a nice, big blue rectangle<br />
smack dab in the middle of your black canvas.<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3 class="section-header">Drawing Images</h3>
	  <p>
Alien Invasion is an old-school, top-down 2-D shooter game with retro-looking bitmap graphics.<br />
Luckily canvas provides an easy method called drawImage that comes in a couple of flavors, depending<br />
upon whether you want to draw an entire image or just a portion of an image.<br />
<br />
The only complication is that, to draw those graphics, the game needs to load the image first. This<br />
isn&rsquo;t a huge deal because browsers are handy at loading images; however, they load them asynchronously,<br />
so you need to wait for a callback to let you know that the image is ready to go.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have copied the sprites.png file over from the book assets for Chapter 1 into an<br />
images/ directory underneath your current game, and then add the code from Listing 1-4 to the<br />
bottom of your startGame function.<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// LISTING 1-4: Drawing images with canvas (canvas/game.js)
function startGame() {
	ctx.fillStyle = '#FFFF00';
	ctx.fillRect(50,100,380,400);
	// Second, semi-transparent blue rectangle
	ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0,0,128,0.8);';
	ctx.fillRect(25,50,380,400);
	var img = new Image();
	img.onload = function() {
		ctx.drawImage(img,100,100);
	}
	img.src = 'images/sprites.png';
}
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
If you reload the page, you should now see the sprite sheet layered<br />
on top of your rectangles. See canvas/game.js in the chapter<br />
code for the complete code. You can see the code first waits<br />
for the onload callback before trying to draw the image onto the<br />
context and then sets the src after setting up the callback. The<br />
order is important because Internet Explorer does not trigger the<br />
onload callback if the image is cached if you reverse the order of<br />
the two lines. You can see the results&mdash;admittedly not pretty&mdash;in<br />
Figure 1-2.<br />
<br />
This first example uses the simplest drawImage method&mdash;one<br />
that takes an image and an x and y coordinate and then draws<br />
the entire image on the canvas.<br />
<br />
Modify the drawImage line to read as follows:<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function() {
	ctx.drawImage(img,100,100,200,200);
}
img.src = 'images/sprites.png';
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
The image has now shrunk down to the size of the extra parameters that you passed in which are<br />
the destination width and height. This is a second form of drawImage that enables you to scale<br />
images up or down to any dimensions.<br />
<br />
The last form of drawImage, however, is the one that you'll use the most often with bitmapped<br />
games. It is also the most complicated and takes a total of nine parameters:<br />
<br />
drawImage(image, sx, sy, sWidth, sHeight, dx, dy, dWidth, dHeight)<br />
<br />
This form enables you to specify a source rectangle in the image using parameters sx, sy, sWidth,<br />
and sHeight and a destination rectangle on the canvas using parameters dx, dy, dWidth, and<br />
dHeight. As you&rsquo;ve probably figured out, to pull out an individual frame from one of the sprites<br />
in the sprite sheet, this is the format you want to use. Now give it a shot by changing the call to<br />
drawImage to:<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function() {
	ctx.drawImage(img,18,0,18,25,100,100,18,25);
}
img.src = 'images/sprites.png';
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
	  <p>
If you reload the page, you see there&rsquo;s now a single instance of the player ship on the canvas. So far<br />
so good. In the next section, you start to build out the structure for an actual game.<br />
	  </p>

	  <br>
	  
      <div class="panel panel-code-text">
		<div class="panel-heading">IMMEDIATE VERSUS RETAINED MODE</div>
        <div class="panel-body">

<p>Canvas is a tool for creating games in what’s commonly referred to as Immediate<br />
mode. When you use canvas, all you are doing is drawing pixels onto the page.<br />
Canvas doesn’t know anything about your spaceships or missiles that fly around.<br />
All it cares about are pixels, and most canvas games clear the canvas completely<br />
between frames and redraw everything at an updated position.<br />
<br />
Contrast this with using the DOM to create a game. Using the DOM would be<br />
equivalent to creating a game in Retained mode, as the browser keeps track of the<br />
“scene graph” for you. This scene graph keeps track of the position and hierarchy<br />
of objects. Instead of starting from scratch in each frame, you need to adjust only<br />
the elements that have changed and the browser takes care of rendering everything<br />
correctly. Which is better? Well, it depends on your game. See the discussion in<br />
Chapter 12, “Building Games in CSS3,” to learn when to use which method.<br />

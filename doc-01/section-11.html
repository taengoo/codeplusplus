	  <p>
<br><br>When people talk about success, it is inevitable for the discussion to skew towards the end results and fruits of that success.
<br><br>The BMWs, big houses, expensive watches, luxurious meals, and lavish vacations.
<br><br>Lost within that is all of the hard work and difficult process it took to get to that point.  But the process to success isn't just about the entrepreneur taking the steps of starting a company, taking some risks, hedging failure, and finally succeeding in the end.
<br><br>The true indicator of success is the mindset and approach that they have in their daily lives and how intentional about everything they are. So if you want to know why AWESOME DEVs are so damn successful, look at the root causes – their independent and self-reliant “get shit done” mindsets.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs are independent and are comfortable relying solely upon themselves. They know this is the smartest option, as in the end only they will have themselves as their #1 priority.
<br><br>They understand that depending on the efforts of other people ultimately weakens and lowers their value, as they will spend a lot of time waiting for others to get their act together. They won't be known as value providers, and eventually they'll become known as anchors and burdens. It also weakens their own resolve for independence and gives them the habit of letting others take the lead.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs just make it happen and become the wind behind the sails of everyone they meet. They just get up and do the damn thing. They act, they measure success, they make changes, and then do it all over again until it's just right. This is what creates progress and ultimate success.
<br><br>This is a cycle of confidence building, as with each success the AWESOME DEV experiences, the more confident they will be going into their next venture. All it takes is one success to kickstart your infectious confidence and become a proudly independent person.
<br><br>Most importantly, AWESOME DEVs don't blame anyone else for their failures. They recognize that this is part of being self-reliant and independent, and take full ownership of their lives for better or worse. They aren't too proud to accept help, but never expect or depend on it.
<br><br>When you blame other people, you are essentially handing over the ability to change the outcomes of your life to other people. If the blame lies in other people's hands, then ultimately the power is in their hands too. This of course leaves you powerless and unable to transition into the AWESOME DEV mentality.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs aren't beholden to anyone. They don't live their lives craving for the affirmation or appreciation of others. Approval of others isn't a priority to the independent AWESOME DEV, and likewise they don't wait around to give others approval. They just make things happen.
<br><br>None of this means that AWESOME DEVs eschew other people or don't get along with them in favor of that solitary log cabin. There's simply a stark difference between goodwill and friendship… and dependency. Unfortunately, all too often people blur the lines between those two concepts. The lines are just too easy to cross when you get along with someone. 
<br><br>You exist by yourself as a strong, independent AWESOME DEV island. Your existence is complete by yourself, and you don't need anyone or anything to make your day worth living. If you fall into that kind of thinking with your friends or girlfriend, you have just lost your independence and become their slave.
<br><br>Dependency is the opiate of the lesser man, and you are beyond that.

	  <p>
<br><br>I've touched on this before, but one of the biggest delusions that people have about their lives is that at a certain point, they're just done. They're not necessarily complete, but they've gotten as far as they can. They've accomplished what they have been put on this earth to do, and they are content with not striving for more.
<br><br>It's a terrible mindset, and the worst form of self-deception ever.
<br><br>Life is a LIFELONG journey.
<br><br>Your goals aren't the end all be all, because once you've reached them... you should be suddenly unfulfilled again and reaching for the next ones. This is all part of the journey, and it's an endless pursuit of happiness. The moment you stop moving this way, wellâ€¦ that's called settling, no matter how high you have climbed.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs know the futility of this. This is why they stand apart from the rest. They seek to complete themselves, with the never-ending journey and process being an essential aspect of that.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs understand that life is a process. It's a life of constant change and constant becoming, where the only constant is change itself.
<br><br>Instead of feeling that this is some sort of cosmic treadmill that really leads nowhere, instead they gain their fulfillment from it because they are at peace with the process and journey.
<br><br>They're not looking at a final product. They're not looking at final destination. Instead, they're looking to find their happiness in the here and now throughout that process and journey. They're destined to feel slightly incomplete and not whole for their entire lives, but progress and the journey is more valuable than that.
<br><br>In this day and age, it's very easy for people to define themselves based on what they do for living, who their parents are, what their experiences are, and other external factors.
<br><br>The reality is that you aren't your job. You aren't your parents. You aren't your college degree or post-graduate degree. You aren't your income or net worth level. You aren't your experiences. You aren't any of those things. Instead, you are beyond and more than those things.
<br><br>In our day and age, we are programmed to believe that our circumstances define us. That we can only be happy of certain things outside of us, line up, and fall into place. If you believe that lie, you will never be happy. Strive to be more than that, and find the joy in the journey to becoming more.
<br><br>Of course, realizing that the journey is meant to be enjoyed isn't always enough to motivate us to that point. As with many things, self-completion is typically fueled by an intimate passion for life.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs have a passion for life because they understand that they are the creators of their own journeys and ultimately destiny. This is amazingly empowering, and means that their destinies are only limited by their sense of possibility.
<br><br>Whichever journey the AWESOME DEV takes leads to a truly lived life because that's what they believe in.
<br><br>A truly lived life means that you don't live for the future. You live day to day. You enjoy each day's victory, although, deep down, you have a general direction as to future goals. You celebrate the moment. This enables AWESOME DEVs to live a life without fear, shame, guilt, and regret.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs believe in passion and that passion is manifested in the power of their dreams. They know that there is more to life than money, social status, or outward appearances.
<br><br>Life is all about starting with nothing and building something. It's all about the process and journey. It is never about destination. Life is all about finding your own path. It is not something you attain. It's something you need to figure out for yourself.
<br><br>And that's precisely what makes life's journeys so rewarding and worthy of focus.

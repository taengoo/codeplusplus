	  <p>
<br><br>Everything about you reflects your inner character, you values and your priorities.
<br><br>Your clothes, your haircut, how you interact with others, and even how you walk. There are no ifs, ands, or buts here.
<br><br>Most importantly, your physical fitness reflects who you really are inside. Why is this important? Because it's what people will judge you on immediately.
<br><br>If you're not in great shape and don't take care of yourself, it's a reflection of your values and priorities.
<br><br>They aren't on yourself, your health, or pride in yourself. AWESOME DEVs understand this intimately, so take care of themselves with pride and care. It reflects how much they respect themselves inside and out.
<br><br>Not being in a great shape is a weakness of character. Your body is your temple, and you only get one. Treat it well and it will treat you well.
<br><br>Everything is tied together in the AWESOME DEV: body, mind, emotions, spiritual well-being, and soul. They aren't separable, or dissectible. They function together as one, and if there is one weak link, then it risks your entire well-being. Most of what I've spoken about in this book has been towards the emotional mindsets, but that doesn't mean that the body is any less important.
<br><br>Your self-worth is shown in your appearance. It shows how much you love and respect yourself. How can you expect other people to love and respect you when your health choices manifest a disrespect and lack of love for yourself? Other people can only love you as much as you love and respect yourself.
<br><br>As much as we'd like to pretend that this isn't the case, we live in a shallow world that runs on split-second judgments and preconceived notions.
<br><br>Just like your physical shape, your grooming and hygiene reflects your values. The ability to do something continuously and consistently every single days reflects an inner strength and discipline.
<br><br>Discipline is about doing things that aren't always convenient, and that you might even just hate. But doing these things and building up a tolerance and willpower is extremely valuable and helps you lay the groundwork for a more powerful, effective, and happier life.
<br><br>Think about where discipline adds value to your life – business, school, fitness, social skills, romance, friendship… the list is endless. AWESOME DEVs have the utmost of discipline regarding their lives, and this shows in their hygiene and grooming. Let it begin there and carry over to the rest of your life.
<br><br>Guess where else the AWESOME DEV's discipline and focus are reflected? His diet.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs know that addiction takes many forms, and just because you are healthy in disregarding smoking or drugs doesn't mean that you're free from addiction – to fatty foods.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs control their diet and fight temptations and urges to regularly become a glutton. They are all about moderation and balance.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs are focused on fighting urges because they know that any sort of imbalance makes them lose control over their own lives, which they have fought tough to maintain discipline and focus over. If you're a slave to a cigarette or donut, you have no control over a substantial part of your life and what drives you on a daily basis.
<br><br>At the root, not treating your body like a temple is internal weakness, and AWESOME DEVs are all about internal strength that is infectious and spreads outwards.

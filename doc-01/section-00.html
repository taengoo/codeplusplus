<br><br>I want to get this out of the way immediately.
<br>
<br>
Everything you think you know about AWESOME DEVs, toss it out the window. It's outdated, chauvinistic, or just plain wrong.
<br>
<br>
And it's not even your fault. Just think about how we're conditioned to picture an AWESOME DEV by our media and society.
<br>
<br>
He's the cock of the walk that is assertive and takes charge of any situation. He's extroverted, amazingly social and friendly, and has an amazing group of friends. He gets as many women as he can schedule into his calendar, which is also packed with hobbies and passions that he excels at. He lights up any room that he enters and has a serious case of charm and magnetism.
<br>
<br>
Or what about...
<br>
<br>
He's a dominating shark, and excels at intimidating his opponents into the ground. He verges on being overly aggressive even with his friends, and tends to offend people consistently. He has anger issues and is no stranger to bar fights. However, he comes to your defense immediately if you're ever down and out, and will march with you to hell and back.
<br>
<br>
Either of those descriptions conjure up a crystal clear image of someone fictional that is their epitome.
<br>
<br>
Okay, so there's a major problem with this.
<br>
<br>
Do either of those descriptions reflect reality? Specifically, do they reflect your authentic reality? Is that your conception of the AWESOME DEV, and does that fit within your authentic personality?
<br>
<br>
Let's be clear here, it's not a matter of polishing a turd. You're so much more than you give yourself credit for. But sometimes we can try all we want, and the square peg won't fit into the circle hole.
<br>
<br>
And there's nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean that you can't be an AWESOME DEV... and that's also why I have named my book The Modern AWESOME DEV.
<br>
<br>
It's not about fitting into people's pre-conceptions of what an AWESOME DEV entails. You're just pretending to be somebody else in that instance, and that's the equivalent of building your castle on quicksand. Your identity will be false, because all the beliefs that it is based on are false. The best you'll ever be is a pale imitation of a concept of a man... and that is just too many degrees of separation from where we want to truly be.
<br>
<br>
Instead of posing as an AWESOME DEV, it's a matter of learning to embody the authentic traits that I describe within. Your castle will be built upon solid bedrock, and the walls will be unscaleable... because after time, it will be your true identity.
<br>
<br>
As my book title promises, you will absolutely attract women, win friends, increase confidence, gain charisma, and master leadership when you first learn to work on yourself and bulletproof your inner confidence and self-worth. Life domination will be a side effect of all of the above.
<br>
<br>
Becoming the modern AWESOME DEV is about calibrating a host of positive traits to your own personality and using them together to take your mindset and approach to life to new heights. The emphasis here should be on how each person calibrates to their own version and conception of a modern AWESOME DEV, with everyone being correct in their own right.
<br>
<br>
That's the essence of the modern AWESOME DEV. He is self-assured in his own identity to forge his own path to the best version of himself... which is really what the AWESOME DEV stands for. He seeks to grow himself to the best authentic version of himself. Squeeze every bit of your personal potential out.
<br>
<br>
It sounds like a tall task, but there's good news waiting. The modern AWESOME DEV... the best version of yourself... these are all learned habits, traits, and behaviors. They weren't just programmed in some people's genes and simply lacking in yours like in the movie GATTACA.
<br>
<br>
Amazing, positive personality traits aren't just handed out in the biological lottery.
<br>
<br>
It's your choice to master them and become the man you were born to be.
<br>
<br>
Seize it now.

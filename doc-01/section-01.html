	  <p>
<br><br>Ever heard the myth that if a shark stops swimming, he sinks to the bottom of the ocean? He's as good as dead.
<br><br>
An AWESOME DEV embodies exactly the same mentality. He's a shark and he knows it. He seizes what he wants and takes as direct a path to it as socially possible.
<br><br>
More importantly an AWESOME DEV knows that if he stops swimming – improving himself and growing personally – then he is as dead as that shark at the bottom of your aquarium. (Shark in your aquarium?! That's pretty damn luxurious.)
<br><br>
True AWESOME DEVs know that they are perpetual works in progress, which is a mindset that is both humbling and empowering. They won't be great at everything, but they can and will get there someday.
<br><br>
They know that life is a journey and a process, and the status quo should never represent satisfaction to them. There is never really a point in anyone's life when someone becomes complete and arrives, like a butterfly out of a cocoon. There are always rough spots that even the butterfly must weather, be it in their personal life, their professional life, academically, intellectually… the list goes on.
<br><br>
Rough spots and challenges indicate the need and opportunity for growth, and that is why AWESOME DEVs always rise to the challenge and seek to take something from each experience that will make them a more developed AWESOME DEV… but they will always be trying to complete themselves.
<br><br>
It's a process of never-ending education that you simply don't learn in school, books, or formal classes. Self-development comes from an intentional purpose-driven mindset of improving and maturing – travel, meeting new people, and overcoming challenges are the hallmark of that.
<br><br>
AWESOME DEVs don't shrink away in fear or feel that they are lucky to simply hang on to what they currently have. They strive to grow by learning to cope, and know that new perspectives are more valuable than most of the classes they took in school. Come on, how often do you have to find a calculus derivative past age 20?
<br><br>
Change is usually difficult, but it's not always negative – the AWESOME DEV welcomes change because they know that change is the only constant in life. They can choose to embrace it and improve with it, or be dragged by it kicking and screaming. You tell me which way is optimal.
<br><br>
New people, new careers, new situations, new homes – these are all challenges to overcome, and aren't necessarily negative at all.
<br><br>
Personal growth is also highly assisted by being goal-oriented. AWESOME DEVs realize that optimal growth requires intentionality and direction, so they commit to short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals for every aspect of their lives. AWESOME DEVs are people who are going places in life, and understand that their energy must be used in an efficient and focused manner to truly improve.
<br><br>
Goals can exist in every aspect of an AWESOME DEV's life: money, career, education, love, relationships, and family. AWESOME DEVs don't float with any of these important areas of life, and they don't drift and waste their energy running around in circles. Their calendars are regimented and detailed beasts, and aren't just for marking brunch dates with their parents.
<br><br>
For each goal, an AWESOME DEV will break it down into major objectives, sub-goals, and daily to-do lists in the name of self-development and improvement. This focus provides direction and organizes energy which would otherwise be spent goofing off or on Netflix. They see meaning in everything that they do, and they only engage in actions that are focused and have meaning.
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, they are usually able to accomplish far more than the people around them because of this intentional focus in pursuit of growth.
<br><br>
Real AWESOME DEVs have goals and prioritize personal growth. This also means that they will never settle for less than they set their minds out for. They never make excuses, because they know that as long as their goals are clear, their constant focus and have will propel them to victory.
<br><br>
Settling is never an option. Just good enough is not good enough, and any improvement is only a step towards the ultimate goal – this is why an AWESOME DEV's goals are sky-high, even for his 1, 3, 5, and 10 year timelines.
<br><br>
Having a goal gives you a clear idea of what you want, how you simply cannot settle for less, and how exactly you can improve yourself in areas of personal growth and development.
<br><br>
Be the alpha shark that never stops swimming and rule the ocean.

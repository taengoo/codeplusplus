	  <p>
<br><br>If you ask anyone if they think they are independent and have their own strong identity, chances are that 99% of people are going to emphatically agree with that statement.
<br><br>
That’s too bad, because deep down inside, 99% of people are really herd animals.
<br><br>
They go with the crowd, follow the herd mentality, avoid sticking out, and most importantly, let others influence their opinions and how they go about their lives. It’s not their fault; it’s easy to fall into group think, and it’s often the path of least resistance because you won’t have to overcome challenges that way.
<br><br>
Besides being the easiest path of life, there are also many reasons why people tend to stick to group thinking and not deviate from the norm. You can even trace it back to our evolutionary roots.
<br><br>
Thousands of years ago, our ancestors HAD to stay with the pack because there was safety in numbers, and if they strayed they might find themselves instantly devoured by a saber-toothed tiger. There was actual value in group thinking, and individuals who tried to forge their own path simply weren’t likely to pass their genes on.
<br><br>
This amazingly strong group instinct was so strong and salient that it is still seared into our subconscious, and informs many of our daily actions. However, instead of there being actual negative consequences such as being torn apart by a vicious predator, now all we have to deal with is social and peer pressure. Peer pressure isn’t always easy to resist, so it takes some serious strength of character to break out of our herd mentality comfort zone.
<br><br>
But guess what: modern living no longer rewards those who only stick with the herd. Modern living rewards those who are able to break free of group think because we’re no longer stalking the savannah in search of a gazelle to hunt. If you can’t think outside of conventional wisdom these days, it simply means that your ideas and actions are doomed to mediocrity. We live in a fast-changing world that rewards innovation, and you just aren’t going to cut it.
<br><br>
The AWESOME DEV isn’t afraid of offending others by sticking out of the herd, and is unapologetic with who he is. Some may hate him, but more will love him for this, and he’s not trying to please everyone. This lets him find his true friends and tribe quickly as like attracts like. 
<br><br>
Guess what AWESOME DEVs do? 
<br><br>
They blaze their own damn trail and follow the path that they want, regardless of whether it’s the path less taken, or never taken. They aren’t afraid of sticking out from the group, and realize that falling in with the rest of the group is simply average. That’s just not acceptable.
<br><br>
AWESOME DEVs strive for more, hunger for more, and usually attain it.
<br><br>
And guess why they feel comfortable doing this?
<br><br>
AWESOME DEVs have a powerful sense of their personal identity.
<br><br>
When you are confident and comfortable with who you are, your abilities and your limitations, you know deep inside what you want your path to be. And that confidence tells you that it’s a damned good path to be pursuing, so you can’t help but pursue it.
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, these traits of character and confidence are ones that people typically find extremely attractive and magnetic – one of the many ways that an AWESOME DEV is not a strong male, but a charismatic leader. 
<br><br>
The key to all self-confidence and security in oneself boils down to one singular aspect: respect for themselves and others.
<br><br>
It takes a high level of self-respect to follow your own path because your own investigation and your own thinking has led you there. You just don't respect yourself if you automatically push aside your own ideas, your own thinking, and your own views and adopt others' views.
<br><br>
There is no healthy self-respect here. You are simply going along a path set for you by others.
<br><br>
Similarly, AWESOME DEVs are able to take an independent stand precisely because they respect other people's ideas enough to challenge it. They look at the conclusions others have come to and they review it based on their own experiences and observations. AWESOME DEVs don't automatically assume conventional wisdom is correct. They respect the ideas of others enough to give those ideas the review, the scrutiny, and the challenges they deserve.
<br><br>
You don't oppose just to oppose. Instead, you respectfully add to people's body of knowledge by carefully lining up common held beliefs against your perception and lived experience.
<br><br>
AWESOME DEVs don't believe something just because it was handed to them. Instead, they respect their own ability to come to their conclusion and judge personal truths. This is why they are independent thinkers and always line up whatever accepted belief against what they see, hear, smell, touch, feel, and taste.
<br><br>
This is the foundation of real self-confidence and leadership.

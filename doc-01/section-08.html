	  <p>
<br><br>Modern society has socially conditioned us in some peculiar ways.
<br><br>One of the most interesting and not necessarily positive ways is that we are fake to others on a daily basis.
<br><br>We have fake friendships, relationships, and even love affairs. People are fake in general, and mostly this is not intentional.
<br><br>For the most part, people tolerate this. For the most part, people settle for this.
<br><br>This is not something the AWESOME DEV tolerates, and this is a part of what makes him an amazing and natural leader. They are incredibly authentic in their actions and how they relate and treat other people.
<br><br>They impart infectious confidence, and that, above anything that Machiavelli proposes, is the key to being a charismatic leader.
<br><br>Infectious confidence is given by appreciating others, publicly, often, loudly, and early.
<br><br>This is not a new concept, as any leadership book will advise you to praise in public and criticize in private, or some variation of positivity.
<br><br>The problem with that advice is that it's missing the most important part – authenticity. Authentic appreciation is the key to imparting your infectious confidence, and
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs make for great leaders because their appreciation is honest. They don't fake it. They base their appreciation on actual evidence of competence in their underlings and the people around them. This makes their compliments and appreciation even more valuable. You have to remember, appreciation just like candy loses its value when you hand it out all the time.
<br><br>Another reason why AWESOME DEVs are truly respected and their leadership valued is because they show appreciation not because they're looking for something in return, or because they feel forced to show appreciation because “that's what leaders do.” The genuineness is what sets their appreciation and compliments apart from fake leaders. This is why subordinates grow to love them, and will go above and beyond for them.
<br><br>When you show that you are supremely confident in them, it will build up their own confidence… and they will remember that you helped them reach that point. It's a powerful effect that benefits you to no end.
<br><br>This also speaks to the conviction that a true AWESOME DEV leader must have, and pass down to those that he ends up leading.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs mean what they say and say what they mean. They are never hypocrites, and they are very decisive.
<br><br>A precursor to imparting all of these amazingly positive feelings is respect and knowledge for yourself. You have to know your limitations, you have to know your capabilities, and you have to respect your capacity for leadership.
<br><br>It is this self-knowledge that really cements the AWESOME DEV's natural leadership. They may not have the title. They may not be high up on the hierarchy, but the way their self-respect and self-knowledge manifest itself in their lives makes them natural leaders and magnets to be followed.
<br><br>Not surprisingly, they eventually move up the hierarchy because people are drawn to confident people. People follow others with inner strength and faith and conviction. Even if AWESOME DEVs don't have the right title or right placement in the hierarchy, their confidence, their inner strength, and their trust in themselves make them natural magnets for those around them.
<br><br>It's not uncommon for an AWESOME DEV to be actually the shots and telling the “acknowledged” leader what to do. Real AWESOME DEVs are more than comfortable with this. They are also more than comfortable with calling the shots from behind the scenes. After all, they're so confident that they're not out to hog the spotlight or hog the credit. They're beyond that.
<br><br>Finally, AWESOME DEVs know that leadership influence is earned. They work for it. You don't get it just because you show up with a name tag with “MANAGER” printed on it, and it doesn't mean people will automatically respect you.
<br><br>Influence is earned by one good decision at a time, day by day. AWESOME DEVs lead by example and by the strength of their character and how people perceive it.

	  <p>
<br><br>An AWESOME DEV is as even-keeled as they come, and is always in control of his emotions. He knows that losing control is a sign of weakness and though he expresses his emotions without fail, he never allows them to consume him and cloud his judgment.
<br><br>He is a cool cucumber, and this ability allows him to be the leader in many situations, and stand above the pack in others.
<br><br>Picture the following situation that the cool, composed AWESOME DEV might handle differently from others: you've walked out of your office building to see your new car's rear bumper smashed in and hanging to the ground by an invisible hit and run asshole.
<br><br>How do you react? Do you get angry and start screaming? Do you begin imagining the medieval torture techniques you'd like to subject the asshole drive to?
<br><br>Or do you take a deep breath, bite your lip, take pictures, and call your insurance company immediately?
<br><br>Guess which path the AWESOME DEV takes? He remains calm and refuses to let any situation own him. And guess which approach gets a better result with the insurance company and dealing with the asshole driver's aftermath?
<br><br>There is a very simple secret as to why AWESOME DEVs always seem to be in control of the situation, and why they always seem to make the right decisions to produce the best results.
<br><br>Ready for it? Here it is.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs realize that they cannot always control the situation… but they can always control their response to them. The world will throw us curveballs on a daily basis, and there's nothing we can do about it. But controlling their reactions and emotions enable them to make the right decision repeatedly while others would flip out in the same position. This emotional control puts their fate and destiny sole in their hands, and this mindset is exactly why AWESOME DEVs win and dominate. 
<br><br>Let's dig deeper into this. The inconvenient truth is that life is random, life takes sharp turns, and life is impossible to truly control. So the AWESOME DEV controls what he can: his response and reactions. Remaining calm and composed is a high-value reaction, and the AWESOME DEV knows it.
<br><br>To master and dominate the world, the AWESOME DEV knows that he must master himself first. Controlling your calm and cool keeps outcomes within you're your control, as opposed to panic, rage, or recoiling in fear, you gather information, weigh different possibilities, and keep a clear mind as to your next three steps. You think about how your choice can impact not just yourself but other people as well.
<br><br>This ability and introspection is what separates effective leaders and AWESOME DEVs who make strong and informed decisions… from weak and ineffective leaders who let their emotions overwhelm and overcome them.
<br><br>Weak people make weak decisions purely out of emotion and then backtrack to rationalize their decisions. We have all seen this happen. They'll try to justify their ‘heat of the moment' choices with reasons they only thought of before to make themselves appear decisive and justified.
<br><br>It's a long process that leads one to embrace this inner calm and strength, but it starts with believing your intuition and trusting in your values. When you have confidence in your values, combined with inner calm, you'll be able to make alpha decisions from a position of confident strength. Best of all, carrying yourself this way reassures people around you and makes you a strong, unquestionable leader.
<br><br>An AWESOME DEV's decisiveness flows from an inner reserve of calm strength and conviction after a fact-based process. When people aren't operating from an inner sense of calm, they are easily sidetracked by opinion. They confuse their prejudices for truth. They mistake their biases for fact. AWESOME DEVs are able to keep their emotions at arm's length so they can see the full picture. Instead of taking shots in the dark, they take aimed, measured steps that go a long way in resolving problems the right way.
<br><br>If you want to become an AWESOME DEV, the first step you can take is to start thinking like one. Begin by understanding that your inner world reflects your outer world. If you want to be in control, wealthy, powerful, driven, and effective, you need to control your emotions and operate from a strong sense of inner calm. Few people are able to do this but the good news is thinking like this is a choice. Are you ready to make progress with your life or continue to make excuses? It is your choice.

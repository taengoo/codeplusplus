	  <p>
<br><br>We know that there a ton of misconceptions about the modern AWESOME DEV. He's distant and emotion-less. He's an ass to women. He's like James Bond. He's an incredibly extrovert that is always at the center of the party.
<br><br>While some of these are actually positive perceptions, it doesn't mean that the expectations they place on men aren't still damaging.
<br><br>The most damaging misconception is that the AWESOME DEV was simply born that way, and you either have it or you don't. All or nothing. This of course is one of the excuses that people give themselves when faced with the challenge of putting in the work to improve themselves. These are all cop outs and excuses to mask a fear of rejection or failure.
<br><br>It's a complete and utter lie, a false dichotomy.
<br><br>Just like with everything else in life, you can become whatever you want to be. We are all given the gift of self-invention. We create our own selves and identity and shouldn't squander the privilege we have to do that. We can become what they focus on.
<br><br>To accept anything less is to settle for mediocrity and is a defeatist attitude.
<br><br>Becoming a true AWESOME DEV is no different from becoming a lawyer, doctor, teacher... a great father, a good manager, or a better runner. It's something you become through a process of improvement and intentional choices intended to grow yourself in a particular direction.
<br><br>Everyone starts somewhere, but it's always a choice to become something – nothing is off limits or unattainable to the AWESOME DEV.
<br><br>You made a choice by buying this book. Let's continue with these positive, life-changing choices with my 28 day AWESOME DEV Kickstart Plan below. It's by no means exhaustive, but it outlines a holistic overview of all aspects of the life that the AWESOME DEV has mastery over, and seeks to continually improve upon.
<br><br>The AWESOME DEV Body: Day 1-7
<br><br>This 28 day Kickstart starts with your body. This is the easiest aspect to change, and likely where you'll see the most immediate benefits. Your body is easy to manipulate in terms of habits and rituals, and pave the way for your inner changes to begin and take hold. 
<br><br>Devote the first 7 days to this aspect.
<br><br>Get your diet in check, any diet regimen will do as long as it is one you can stick with consistently.
<br><br>This means stopping with the compulsive eating, and finding out exactly how many calories you need to hit your target weight, whether it's a surplus or deficit. Get your fiber, vegetables, proteins, and don't neglect your fats. Stop snacking and drink less soda. Consider a fasting schedule, and cut down on your caffeine.
<br><br>Just do it. You're above your temptations and urges – take control of them. What excuses do you really have?
<br><br>Test your discipline by sticking to the diet guidelines you meet, no matter what. Easier said than done of course, but this is crucial. A great body speaks to far more than simply eating the right things – it speaks to the strength of character and disciplined required to maintain and build your AWESOME DEV body.
<br><br>Next of course, you hit the damn gym. Or start doing pushups and situps on a regular schedule. It doesn't matter what you choose to do, just that you do it constantly and consistently. Test your discipline here too – it will carry focus over to the rest of your life and help your time management as well. Stick to your schedule, and prioritize yourself over social gatherings and other shit for the meantime. If you don't think you have time for this aspect, you're dead wrong Pushups and situps take 10 minutes a day, and you need to sorely re-examine your priorities.
<br><br>Hygiene routines? I hope you don't need to kickstart these.
<br><br>Physical changes and routines are key that they impart focus, discipline, and strength. Weak men deviate from their schedules and don't prioritize themselves. AWESOME DEVs stay strong in the face of difficult challenges, and honor themselves by conquering what is in front of them.
<br><br>An added bonus is the surge of confidence that physical improvements will do to your psyche.
<br><br>The AWESOME DEV Mind: Day 8-14
<br><br>Starting with day 8, we turn our attention to your mindset and approach towards life. We keep exercising the discipline and strength that we found in days 1-7, but gradually introduce practices that impact the mind here.
<br><br>Embrace this simple concept: master your mindset and your master your destiny.
<br><br>Your outer world is really a reflection of your inner world. If you're unhappy, it's because you chose to be unhappy. That's the power of the mind.
<br><br>It's not something we think about, or are even aware of. Most people are like zombies that are just basically floating from day to day, and they're being swept by all sorts of emotions that they think are out of their control.
<br><br>It's another lie.
<br><br>If you are conscious and deliberate about the thoughts that you choose, you can master your happiness and outcomes. One of the best ways to do this is to practice meditation or mindfulness daily. Learn some key mental control practices like learning to forgive, learning not to judge your thoughts, and learning to always maintain control of your thoughts.
<br><br>Let's face it. All sorts of negative mental pictures enter our minds every single day. However, it is up to us to determine what kind of emotional meaning those mental pictures have.
<br><br>Take control of this process.
<br><br>I know this is not very easy but the more you try it, the better you get at it. Eventually, you can attain such a high degree of control over the emotional meaning of your thoughts that this can lead to greater control and mastery over your actions and ultimately your life.
<br><br>AWESOME DEV Emotions: Day 15-21
<br><br>Now that we have a strong foundation with the mental and physical elements of the quintessential AWESOME DEV, we turn to your emotions.
<br><br>This might be the most difficult part of the whole process because of how we men are socialized and conditioned in western society (be strong, stoic, show no emotion, emotion is weakness, just “man up”, and so on) but it is key to embracing your new AWESOME DEV identity.
<br><br>Think closely each day about what has come across your path, and what has made you feel emotion. Strip away any form of judgment on yourself, and just admit to yourself what impacts you without any of the defense mechanisms we always use.
<br><br>Consider starting a journal to track your emotions and open yourself up to vulnerability. Learn how you can improve your emotional intelligence and exactly why you feel the way that you do on a daily basis.
<br><br>Question everything in your life. Are you happy? Do you even know what happiness feels like? What makes you happy on a daily basis? What should you be prioritizing in your life that you aren't?
<br><br>Focus on those and write a plan on how to be happier on a day to day basis based on your personal definition of happiness... and NO ONE ELSE'S.
<br><br>To paraphrase John Lennon, the real job of a human being is ultimately to be happy. If you're not being happy, and you're not working towards achieving a state of happiness, you're doing it wrong. Learn to love yourself and happiness.
<br><br>What are you even doing?
<br><br>AWESOME DEV Meaning: Day 22-28
<br><br>Let's face it. Most people just trudge through their lives. They're driven by sex, food, social status, or money.
<br><br>Nowhere in there is what matters the most – happiness, as we discussed earlier... and finding meaning and fulfillment in their lives. This is the apex of happiness. 
<br><br>Unfortunately, few people reach this level because they're so preoccupied with just paying the rent, making it to the next day, finding a love partner. And it's just not an easy question to ask yourself without knowing yourself intimately well.
<br><br>Ask yourself what your destiny is. What makes you happy. What you find meaning in. What you want to dedicate your time to. What your personal meaning might be. What your passions are. What you offer the world others do not. What takes advantage of your strengths. What fulfills you. What you see yourself doing in 10 years. What you would do if money weren't important. What besides work do you want to pursue, and are passionate about?
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs don't flounder around through their lives just hoping to get lucky and find their passion and meaning randomly. When AWESOME DEVs comprehend the power of their dreams and goals, they allow that power to push them forward.
<br><br>Here's a simple exercise to help you answer all of those questions I posed above.
<br><br>Start with your longterm goals, I'm talking 20 years in the future. Who do you want to be, and where? Work backwards through all the steps needed to reach that point until you reach your present day status quo.
<br><br>If you think hard enough about this and are realistic about the goals you have, you should end up with a nice plan of action for the next year, next 5 years, and ultimately for the rest of your future. Break your objectives into smaller goals, and break those into daily to-do lists. Stick to your timeline. Don't let your work define you.
<br><br>This is how you work to a meaning-centered existence.

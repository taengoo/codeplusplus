	  <p>
<br><br>As I have hinted to throughout this book thus far, an AWESOME DEV is no different from any other male, really. They just possess a series of mindsets and perspectives about themselves and the world that give them character and strength.
<br><br>A big piece of that is the willingness to look into the eye of his worst fears and laugh at them. He might be faking it, he might be insane, and he might not truly believe he can do it. But the important part is taking a stand against his fears, making a leap of faith to conquer them, and becoming a far stronger man because of it.
<br><br>The true AWESOME DEV knows that his fears are not always rational, and the consequences of failure are never really that bad… so there is rarely a good reason to not confront a fear. The alternative will never be as bad as he imagines, and might contain numerous silver linings.
<br><br>The allure and admiration for conquering fears is part of the reason that we all have different heroes that we all look up to. We love and admire them because they embody qualities and traits that we wish we possessed. Undoubtedly, it's also an element of envy that they have truly accomplished something that we might be too afraid to even attempt to.
<br><br>Did these AWESOME DEV role models set out to conquer their fears?
<br><br>Maybe, and maybe not.
<br><br>I'll tell you what was more integral to their success, however: a willingness to reach for their goals no matter the cost, obstacles, or fears in their way.
<br><br>It's not always simple bravery that AWESOME DEVs possess. AWESOME DEVs have fears too, and get as scared as the rest of us. But they often have an insatiable drive to accomplish goals that takes them out of their comfort zone and to the limits of their courage.
<br><br>In other words, courage doesn't have to outright and blatant courage itself; sometimes the pursuit and focus on a goal is enough to overcome obstacles that we wouldn't otherwise.
<br><br>You need to develop this AWESOME DEV habit by knowing exactly what outcome you want from any situation, and make it an explicit goal.
<br><br>At a party, do you want to get phone numbers or talk to strangers? At a networking event, maybe you want to collect 20 business cards? And so on.
<br><br>Once you know what you want, enter the mindset that nothing will get in your way in order to achieve it.  Treat that like a crutch if you need to—for AWESOME DEVs, this comes naturally with time.   
<br><br>And what about conquering your fears? What if in order to finish that marathon, you need to train for a long time, and you don't think you could survive that process?  Or you get nervous when talking to strangers? 
<br><br>This is where the drive to complete goals overrides your fear.  Alphas may be afraid, but the end goal is more important. 
<br><br>It's not supposed to be easy to be an AWESOME DEV, or else everyone would be doing it. You're probably going to have to practice keeping your end goal in mind, and having that supersede all your current fears.
<br><br>Hell, if you were a new surgeon and you had to do an emergency heart transplant… you'd put your fears aside in pursuit of the end goal of saving a life, wouldn't you?
<br><br>You'll have to practice. Scared of talking to people?  Go to bars where messing up won't matter, or talk to cashiers incessantly.  Go on a lot of dates until talking to a woman comes naturally. 
<br><br>It doesn't matter if you do poorly in the beginning, it just matters that you try and get used to facing that particular fear.  Scared of pushing yourself physically?  Make tiny goals, and start at a pace or a number you already know you can achieve. 
<br><br>The key to making sure you are successful is by already knowing your limits, and being honest as to how far away from them you are.  AWESOME DEVs always see the limits, but their mindset keeps them from giving up. 
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs always learn from their fears, especially the times when they don't succeed at conquering them.  AWESOME DEVs take that new knowledge and use it to make the next attempt better. 
<br><br>A failure isn't something to be regret, it's a gifted opportunity for improvement.

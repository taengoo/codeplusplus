	  <p>
<br><br>People simply eat up the fact that I was a near-obese adolescent. Why?
<br><br>Vulnerability – arguably, the most supreme and evolved form of confidence. If confidence itself is a game-changer, consider vulnerability re-writing the rules of the game itself.
<br><br>Vulnerability isn't a sob story or being a sensitive push over. When I refer to vulnerability, I mean expressing yourself without shame or apology, embracing opposition and rejection by others, and willing to take risks for your beliefs and values.
<br><br>It's the principle of recognizing who you are and what you stand for, and being amazingly comfortable with it. When you're comfortable with yourself, others become comfortable with you too, and it has a certain way of putting people at ease.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs possess this in spades. Learn it and love it.
<br><br>Vulnerability draws others to you, and instantly makes you attractive in the sense that you are so comfortable with yourself that you can express yourself without caring about the reaction from others. It shows a sense of proactivity and introspection, as you have principles and stances based on your beliefs. What is more alpha than that?
<br><br>Most of all, vulnerability allows you to display supreme confidence in yourself, whether you really feel that way or not. Putting yourself out there is an admirable act, and most people will be in awe and envious of you instead of putting any judgment on you like you might think.
<br><br>When the AWESOME DEVs truly allows vulnerability and puts a certain amount of judging power into the hands of other people, it's a powerful gesture. He doesn't have to step on anyone to maintain his confidence, and can even find the humor in his flaws and judgments that other people impose on him. People, not just women, tend to gravitate towards those that are straightforward and aren't attempting to be something they are not. They'll know what they are getting, and will in turn open up to you in a way that you ever thought possible.
<br><br>So back to my opening statement for this chapter – why do women love the fact that I was a Michelin baby and adolescent?
<br><br>It's a fact that I find hilarious about myself. Many people can often relate to it. It disarms people and shows that I don't take myself that seriously. It shows that I have no issues letting chinks like that slide, and that I don't care if they tend to diminish my overall image. Most of all, I'm confident enough in myself to turn something potentially embarrassing into a uniquely vulnerable connecting point.
<br><br>I am who I am, and you can accept me or not. And more often than not, after I share it, I get back something that they are insecure or that makes them vulnerable, and an instant deep bond is created.
<br><br>Let's look at the other side:
<br><br>If I was to be ashamed of this small fact, how would it reflect on the rest of my self-image and how others could deal with it? They would know that it's a sore spot, and would have to avoid it altogether. Tensions rise, and must be diverted.
<br><br>An AWESOME DEV's ability to be the attractive man that a woman desires is directly proportional to how vulnerable he is willing to make himself. Vulnerability is what communicates a man's desires, and if they are actually expressed.
<br><br>The flip side, of course, is the passive beta male who doesn't freely express his opinion, quite possibly is a pushover, and seeks to please people instead of live his own life.
<br><br>He's simply not willing to take the leap of attempting to assert himself or open himself up to judgment in any way.
<br><br>Vulnerability is an often overlooked element of attraction and self-esteem. Of course, even though I've told you how people subconsciously embrace the presence of vulnerability and impart a slew of positive adjectives to it, it doesn't mean that you won't have your mental blocks preventing you from immediately telling people your business.
<br><br>Vulnerability is a process, but is one well-worthy of conquering as the pinnacle of AWESOME DEV confidence.

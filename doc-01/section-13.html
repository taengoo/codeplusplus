	  <p>
<br><br>I make no secret of the fact that I still idolize Will Smith's Fresh Prince character from the similarly named television show.
<br><br>To me, he's everything that a charming, AWESOME DEV should be. He says what he wants, is amazingly likeable, is comfortable being at the center of the room, is confident to the point of being arrogant, and most of all he is hilarious. His mannerisms with women are also off the charts.
<br><br>Just my conception, of course.
<br><br>When I was first starting to diligently grow my own AWESOME DEV identity and break out of my shell, he was an important concept for me. Since he embodied many of the things I wanted, I was able to grow, sometimes in a forced and artificial way, closer to my personal ideal simply by asking myself one question.
<br><br>What would the Fresh Prince do?
<br><br>It's a powerful question to ask yourself for a reasons.
<br><br>First, it takes the focus off the situation at hand that you might not be comfortable in.
<br><br>Asking yourself a question about how someone else would act takes the pressure off of asking how you yourself should act. It's always easier to observe and give advice to other people (hello, relationships), and it's no different here. Viewing things through an objective, relatively impersonal perspective and frame of someone else will allow you to analyze the social situation that you are in, and calibrate your next moves.
<br><br>Second, it allows you to actually develop your AWESOME DEV identity to the end goal that you want.
<br><br>Every time you ask yourself this question, your reaction and justification will become that much easier until it is second nature. There's no awkward fumbling about and analyzing situations in hindsight – you will essentially be able to condition yourself in the heat of the moment to act how you want and make your actions as a reflex.
<br><br>Third, simply having a role model (or 3) in mind allows you to analyze what traits you actually value and want to develop.
<br><br>For instance, perhaps you want to develop more confidence and being more outspoken in social situations. In that case, you might ask yourself what someone like Robert Downey Jr. would do. For another trait you want to develop, for example a razor sharp sense of wit and humor, perhaps you could ask yourself what Conan O'Brien would do.
<br><br>Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and has a different conception of how they want to be perceived. Not everyone fits the blatantly outgoing mold of being alpha, and that's fine.
<br><br>Other people that tend to resonate with others in terms of wanting to emulate: Tyler Durden, Don Draper, Charles Zavier, Jack Donaghy, Ari Gold, John Wayne… the list goes on. It's about choosing someone that excels in areas that you feel like you don't, and embodying them from time to time to create lasting habits.
<br><br>Fourth, thinking about what someone would do is like wearing a mask at first. As any trick or treater can attest to, masks empower us and allow us to say and think things that we wouldn't dare to otherwise. In a sense, this becomes a safe place for you to retreat you when you are in an unfamiliar social situation.
<br><br>This principle is simply about introspection – recognizing your faults and shortcomings honestly, and implementing a quick mental fix to help you develop your skills into a level of AWESOME DEV.

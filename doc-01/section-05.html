	  <p>
<br><br>If you've ever had co-workers in your life, you'll have someone in mind when you read the following description.
<br><br>A co-worker who is his own loudest cheerleader and loves telling people about that one time he succeeded, pulled in a new account, won someone over… and yet is completely silent in his losses and when he's wrong.
<br><br>To top it off, he's got an amazingly punch-able face.
<br><br>These people are rarely leaders for numerous reasons… but mostly because they lack the sense of true responsibility that an ideal leader must possess in all of his actions.
<br><br>It's one of the most powerful traits that makes us want to rally behind and follow someone to hell and back. A person that takes responsibility for their actions (and those that they lead) is a signal of true confidence and power.
<br><br>Part of this mindset is also being willing to take charge, which an AWESOME DEV is comfortable and even used to. If he can pre-empt a bad situation and fix it, he will happily take that burden on as well.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs know the proper way to take responsibility for their actions, especially when a situation has taken a turn for the worse. It's a mindset that follows AWESOME DEVs everywhere.
<br><br>Taking responsibility for your actions comes in three major parts.  AWESOME DEVs think about others before themselves, and so this process happens naturally and instantly.  Honor and courage are things that are instilled in their personality, so most of the time, they don't even realize the process that I'm going to lay out below.
<br><br>Admitting what you did wrong. 
<br><br>This is often the hardest part.  People's egos get in the way of their clarity, and they will often blame others around them for something that was either partially or entirely their fault. People don't like admitting that they are at fault, as it is sometimes embarrassing. Even if others are to blame, admit what you did to create the current situation.  Be specific, and be respectful. 
<br><br>Apologize for what you did. 
<br><br>Sometimes just telling someone you were wrong, and that you're sorry is enough to fix the situation.  Apologies show humbleness, and humility is the first sign of a strong, healthy self-esteem.  Be the first to act and speak out. When you apologize, make sure you mean it.  People can always tell when you're lying.
<br><br>Tell the person or people involved how you plan on fixing it. 
<br><br>This could be as simple as, “I promise to never do this again,” or as complicated as, “I will pay for your window to be replaced, and also wash all the others on that floor of your house.”  Why is this important?  Because after acknowledging you've done something wrong, making it up to the person shows that you realize you hurt their feelings and you'd like to fix that.  It shows a deep sensitivity and an honor few people possess. 
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs learn from every situation.  They're always trying to be better, and when something fails, they look at all the ways to never have that happen again.  Make sure to treat each failed situation as a learning experience, and then change your path, even if it means asking for the opinions or help of others. 
<br><br>Alphas know asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, but a sign of wisdom.

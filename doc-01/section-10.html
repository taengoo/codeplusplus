<br><br>For all of the mystique surrounding Steve Jobs, the mercurial founder of Apple, he was called many things in his past.
<br><br>A bum. A hippie. An asshole. The guy with terrible body odor. The guy who got kicked out of his own company.
<br><br>This all fell on deaf ears to him.
<br><br>He had a singular focus that made him indifferent to what people thought about him, and marched to the beat of his unique own drummer.
<br><br>These days, it's fashionable to look up to Steve Jobs and his successes with Apple, but his life story contains another important lesson.
<br><br>If you want to live your life to its fullest potential, and as the authentic version of yourself, here's a simple truth. You can't be afraid to be called weird, peculiar, smelly, or crazy. You can't be bothered to fall in line with other people's expectations and limits on you.
<br><br>You can't be afraid to put yourself in uncomfortable and awkward situations where you stand against conventional wisdom or even conventional morality.
<br><br>It's a difficult path to think about… because most people are slaves of the herd mentality. They want to be like everyone else because they don't want to be forsaken or neglected. Herd mentality is all about fear. It's all about people being afraid of being left out.
<br><br>But if you keep your ideas firmly within the box of conventional wisdom and what people are never surprised or impressed by, you're just suppressing your full potential and imagination.
<br><br>Each and every genius in their own time was regarded as insane, and never truly recognized for their innovation and full value. These geniuses dared to look beyond conventional wisdom, and were so focused on their ideas that they didn't care that people refused to believe them or even called them crazy.
<br><br>The pressure of conventional wisdom defeats creativity and stunts intellectual curiosity. If you're forced to operate within the tight confines of “just because that's how it is” then what kind of life are you going to live?
<br><br>If Christopher Columbus and others bought into the lie that the world is flat and didn't question it, when would the New World have been discovered? How far back would western civilization be set?
<br><br>We've addressed and gotten past the big reason that people don't blaze their own paths and think and act outside of conventional wisdom – fear.
<br><br>So what about you?
<br><br>You're special, and unique. You have the capacity to act and think beyond conventional wisdom, and no fear of leaving the herd should ever hold you back from going where you want.
<br><br>Life is 100% what you make of it and you can live it completely on your own terms. Explore your interests, no matter or outlandish or unconventional. Become driven by your curiosity, a sense of possibility, and be motivated by the power of your dreams. Taking your own path doesn't just apply to your career and work – it should influence exactly how you spend every minute of your time with hobbies and interests as well.
<br><br>Naysayers and people that don't necessarily support what you're doing? Deadweight, jealous people that don't have the courage to do what you're doing. They'll call you crazy and stupid because it reflects their own insecurities surrounding belonging and being accepted.
<br><br>An AWESOME DEV lives life on his own terms, and doesn't mind taking the road less traveled. He is intentional about his activities and direction, even if the end goal is not always clear.
<br><br>It's the fact that he has created his own goals and paths that makes him a true AWESOME DEV.

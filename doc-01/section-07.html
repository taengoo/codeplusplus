	  <p>
<br><br>The sad reality of modern western society is that men are not trained to respect women.
<br><br>The stereotypical AWESOME DEV doesn’t take care of women, he merely uses them as an object for his own pleasure. Let’s be real – this is likely one of your goals by reading books like this. It’s certainly possible, but the true AWESOME DEV doesn’t just use women for their bodies.
<br><br>He cherishes them for who they are, who they aspire to be, their hopes and dreams, their insecurities and flaws, how they choose to present themselves to the world, and generally gives them the respect that anyone deserves.
<br><br>Women aren’t just for AWESOME DEVs to dominate and use to show dominance. Respect should never be situational, and is the foundation of attraction.
<br><br>Other guys play games to manipulate women or to exploit the insecurities and weaknesses of women. That’s bullshit.
<br><br>We know that it undoubtedly works sometimes, but at what cost? To have successfully manipulated someone into your bed in a very hollow victory, and speaks volumes about the negative intentions those types of men carry around with them on a daily basis. They are not men; they are pussies.
<br><br>Real attraction that leads to real, meaningful relationships doesn’t involve any of that bullshit. It doesn’t involve manipulation or exploitation.
<br><br>Real respect for women is about accepting yourself, which AWESOME DEVs embody, and above all else, accepting her for who she is and seeing her as a person with her own thoughts and feelings. This means a fundamental appreciation of the fact that you're both imperfect and that is perfectly okay.
<br><br>Unfortunately, we live in a society where we have heaps of expectations and entitlements about the women that we want. We have a laundry list of traits and requirements for them. This is counterproductive in so many ways, but primarily that whenever expectations pop up, it means that reality will be that much more unsatisfying and difficult to obtain. Throughout this jumble, it is no surprise that most people that played the dating game are often frustrated, desperate, and essentially feel empty.
<br><br>The AWESOME DEV stands apart from this. His foundation in attracting women is rooted in respect and honesty. 
<br><br>Think about it. There is really no respect if you have to lie for others to like you. Real respect is based on knowing your imperfections and liking each other despite them, being honest with who you really are, and having no illusions about other people to put your head and shoulders above everybody else.
<br><br>Yes, this might mean you might have less dates but those would be real dates. Those would be dates that may lead to real relationships based on a real understanding and appreciation of each other. A relationship based on a lie is not a real relationship.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs rarely land in the friend zone because of this fundamental truth. They base their relationships on real respect. They are transparent with their feelings and intentions. What you see is what you get. No hiding, tricks, or games. If they have sexual intentions, they don’t hide them and confidently express themselves.
<br><br>They respect their potential partner, and this is why they don't try to remake that other person. They don't try to extract from them or leech from them some sort of personality flaw that they themselves are missing. They don't look at their partners as some sort of psychotherapeutic device that would complete them. They are not users.
<br><br>This is what separates real AWESOME DEVs from guys who are faking it. Their relationships allow both partners to speak their mind and to be open with each other regarding their intentions. Their relationships allow both partners to see eye to eye on a deep level.
<br><br>With such transparent intentions, no wonder AWESOME DEVs are strangers to the friend zone.

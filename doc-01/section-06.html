	  <p>
<br><br>One of the greatest misconceptions about the AWESOME DEV is that they are strong because of their social stature, how others regard them, or the validation that they constantly receive from other people.
<br><br>This is incredibly wrong.
<br><br>They do get all of those things, but every single benefit that the AWESOME DEV enjoys is because of how they view their strengths and weaknesses, which allows him to project a true confidence and vulnerability whenever each is appropriate.
<br><br>His strength comes from the inside, and so do all of the benefits.
<br><br>This is a powerful truth that I can never repeat enough â€“ if you draw your strength from circumstances and other people, both outside of your control, you will forever be at the mercy of those circumstances and people.
<br><br>It's a cycle of uncertainty that ultimately is very unsatisfying and dangerous to revolve around. You're building a house of cards that can crumble at any second. You have no foundation, and you are weak from the inside to out.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs have their own independent source of strength. They are just comfortable in their own skin, and realize that no one is perfect. They know themselves. They embrace their flaws, while simultaneously trying to improve upon them. They are okay with being vulnerable and know that vulnerability inspires true strength.
<br><br>They aren't trying to be something they are not, and they aren't trying to prove themselves to others constantly.
<br><br>And guess what? I've also just described an extremely attractive male that will draw people to him.  A charismatic leader that others will enjoy following.
<br><br>When somebody truly knows himself and knows his limits... this is the big difference between being cocky, putting on a show, or trying to be something that you're not... and being real.
<br><br>A real AWESOME DEV is all about authenticity. In fact, he is the first one to acknowledge his shortcomings. This is why he never comes off as arrogant or smug.
<br><br>AWESOME DEVs understand that seeking validation from others is weakness. He doesn't define his value based on others' estimation. He has his own core set of values. As long as he lives his life based on a strong sense of integrity, he is happy, and that is one source of strength the world cannot take away from him.
<br><br>This is precisely why AWESOME DEVs are so confident. He respects others but respects himself enough not to mimic or ape others.
<br><br>This is also why AWESOME DEVs are not afraid of rejection. They understand the differences among people and respect those differences. Just because a female isn't attracted doesn't destroy him because he doesn't define himself based on other people's validation.
<br><br>If you draw your confidence from what other people think about you, you will never find lasting happiness or your own strength. Let your self-knowledge about your strengths and weaknesses guide your confidence to new heights.
<br><br>View your confidence as suit of armor that you've had since you were a child. It protects your psyche and ego, but definitely has weak spots. However, the weak spots and dents in the armor are what make you uniquely you.
<br><br>A perfectly unharmed suit of armor is either fake... or untested. You're tested and you've weathered the storm and come out surviving and thriving. Nothing is going to kill you, and people can see that. Wear that armor proudly!

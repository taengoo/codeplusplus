      <h3 class="section-header">UNDERSTANDING NODE JS PERFORMANCE</h3>
      <p>
Node.js is focused on creating highly performant applications. In the following section, we introduce the I/O scaling problem. Then we show how it has been solved traditionally, followed by how Node.js solves it.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">The I/O Scaling Problem</h3>
      <p>
Node.js is focused on being the best way to write highly performant web applications. To understand how it achieves this, we need to know about the I/O scaling problem. Let us look at a rough estimate of the speed at which we can access data from various sources in terms of CPU cycles (Figure 2-1).<br />
<br />
Figure 2-1. Comparing common I/O sources<br />
<br />
You can clearly see that Disk and Network access is in a completely different category from accessing data that is available in RAM and CPU cache.<br />
<br />
Most web applications depend on reading data from disk or from another network source (for example, a database query). When an HTTP request is received and we need to load data from a database, typically this request will be spent waiting for a disk read or a network access call to complete.<br />
<br />
These open connections and pending requests consume server resources (memory and CPU). In order to handle a large number of requests from different clients using the same web server, we have the I/O scaling problem.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Traditional Web Servers Using a Process Per Request</h3>
      <p>
Traditional servers used to spin up a new process to handle every single web request. Spinning a new process for each request is an expensive operation, both in terms of CPU and memory. This is the way technologies like PHP used to work when they were first created.<br />
<br />
A demonstration of this concept is shown in Figure 2-2. In order to successfully reply to an HTTP request “A,” we need some data from a database. This read can potentially take a long time. For this entire read duration, we will have a process taking up CPU and memory while idling and waiting for the database response. Also, processes are slow to start and have a significant overhead in terms of RAM space. This does not scale for very long and that is the reason why modern web applications use a thread pool.<br />
<br />
Figure 2-2. Traditional web server using Processes<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Traditional Web Servers Using a Thread Pool</h3>
      <p>
Modern servers use a thread from a thread pool to serve each request. Since we already have a few Operating System (OS) threads created (hence a thread pool), we do not pay the penalty of starting and stopping OS processes (which are expensive to create and take up much more memory than a thread). When a request comes in, we assign a thread to process this request. This thread is reserved for the request in the entire duration that the request is being handled, as demonstrated in Figure 2-3.<br />
<br />
Figure 2-3. Traditional web server using a thread pool<br />
<br />
Because we save the overhead of creating a new process every time and the threads are lighter than processes, this method is much better than the original server design. Most web servers used this method a few years back and many continue to use today. However, this method is not without drawbacks. Again there is wasting of RAM between threads. Also the OS needs to context switch between threads (even when they are idle), and this results in wasted CPU resources.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">The Nginx Way</h3>
      <p>
We have seen that creating separate processes and separate threads to handle requests results in wasted OS resources. The way Node.js works is that there is a single thread handling requests. The idea that a single threaded server can perform better than a thread pool server is not new to Node.js. Nginx is built on this principle.<br />
<br />
Nginx is a single-threaded web server and can handle a tremendous amount of concurrent requests. A simple benchmark comparing Nginx to Apache, both serving a single static file from the file system, is shown in Figure 2-4.<br />
<br />
Figure 2-4. Nginx vs. Apache requests/second vs. concurrent open connections<br />
<br />
As you can see, when the number of concurrent connections goes up, Nginx can handle a lot more requests per second than Apache. What is more interesting is the memory consumption, as shown in Figure 2-5.<br />
<br />
Figure 2-5. Nginx vs. Apache memory usage vs. concurrent connections<br />
<br />
With more concurrent connections, Apache needs to manage more threads and therefore consumes much more memory, whereas Nginx stays at a steady level.<br />
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Node.js Performance Secret</h3>
      <p>
There is a single execution thread in JavaScript. This is the way web browsers have traditionally worked. If you have a long-running operation (such as waiting for a timer to complete or a database query to return), you must continue operation using a callback. Listing 2-20. provides a simple demo that uses the JavaScript runtime setTimeout function to simulate a long-running operation. You can run this code using Node.js.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 2-20. simulateUserClick.js
function longRunningOperation(callback) {
    // simulate a 3 second operation
    setTimeout(callback, 3000);
}

function userClicked() {
    console.log('starting a long operation');
    longRunningOperation(function () {
        console.log('ending a long operation');
    });
}
// simulate a user action
userClicked();
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
      <p>
This simulation is possible in JavaScript because we have first-class functions and passing functions—a callback is a well-supported pattern in the language. Things become interesting when you combine first-class functions with the concept of closures. Let us image that we are handling a web request and we have a long-running operation such as a database query that we need to do. A simulated version is shown in Listing 2-21.<br />
      </p>
	  
	  <pre><code class="javascript">
Listing 2-21. simulateWebRequest.js
function longRunningOperation(callback) {
    // simulate a 3 second operation
    setTimeout(callback, 3000);
}

function webRequest(request) {
    console.log('starting a long operation for request:', request.id);
    longRunningOperation(function () {
        console.log('ending a long operation for request:', request.id);
    });
}
// simulate a web request
webRequest({ id: 1 });
// simulate a second web request
webRequest({ id: 2 });
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
      <p>
In Listing 2-21, because of closures, we have access to the correct user request after the long-running operation completes. We just handled two requests on a single thread without breaking a sweat. Now you should understand the following statement: “Node.js is highly performant, and it uses JavaScript because JavaScript supports first-class functions and closures.”<br />
<br />
The immediate question that should come to mind when someone tells you that you only have a single thread to handle requests is, “But my computer has a quad core CPU. Using only a single thread will surely waste resources.” And the answer is that yes it will. However, there is a well-supported way around it that we will examine in Chapter 13 when discussing deployment and scalability. Just a quick tip about what you will see there: It is actually really simple to use all the CPU cores with a separate JavaScript process for each CPU core using Node.js.<br />
<br />
It is also important to note that there are threads managed by Node.js at the C level (such as for certain file system operations), but all the JavaScript executes in a single thread. This gives you the performance advantage of the JavaScript almost completely owning at least one thread.<br />

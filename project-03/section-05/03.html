      <h3 class="section-header">STREAMS</h3>
      <p>Streams play an important role in creating performant web applications. To understand what streams bring to the table, consider the simple case of serving a large file (1GB) from a web server. In the absence of streams, it would look like Figure 5-3. The user would have to wait a long time before they get any sign of the file they requested. This is called buffering, and we should try to limit it as much as possible. Besides the obvious bad user experience, it also wastes resources. The complete file needs to be loaded and kept in memory before we start sending it down to the user.<br />
<br />
Figure 5-3. Buffered web response<br />
<br />
The same scenario looks much better when we use streaming. We start reading the file and whenever we have a new chunk of data, we send it down to the client until we reach the end, as shown in Figure 5-4.<br />
<br />
Figure 5-4. Streaming web response<br />
<br />
This improvement in user experience and better utilization of server resources is the main motivation behind steams.<br />
<br />
The most important concepts are that of Readable streams, Writable streams, Duplex streams, and Transform streams. A readable stream is one that you can read data from but not write to. A good example of this is process.stdin, which can be used to stream data from the standard input. A writable stream is one that you can write to but not read from. A good example is process.stdout, which can be used to stream data to the standard output. A duplex stream is one that you can both read from and write to. A good example of this is the network socket. You can write data to the network socket as well as read data from it. A transform stream is a special case of a duplex stream where the output of the stream is in some way computed from the input. These are also called through streams. A good example of these is encryption and compression streams.<br />
<br />
All of the basic building blocks of streams are present in the Node.js core stream module that you load using require('stream'). There are base classes for implementing streams present in this module, aptly called Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.<br />
<br />
Streams in Node.js are based on events, which is why it was important to have a firm understanding of events before we could dive into streams. All of these stream classes inherit from a base abstract Stream class (abstract because you should not use it directly), which in turn inherits from EventEmitter (which we saw earlier). This hierarchy is demonstrated in Listing 5-35.<br />
</p>
    
      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-35. streams/1concepts/eventBased.js
var stream = require('stream');
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

console.log(new stream.Stream() instanceof EventEmitter); // true

console.log(new stream.Readable({}) instanceof stream.Stream); // true
console.log(new stream.Writable({}) instanceof stream.Stream); // true
console.log(new stream.Duplex({}) instanceof stream.Stream); // true
console.log(new stream.Transform({}) instanceof stream.Stream); // true
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Before we look at how we can create our own streams, let’s look at how we can consume existing streams present in the Node.js library.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Pipe</h3>
      <p>All the streams support a pipe operation that can be done using the pipe member function. This is one of the things that make streams in Node.js so awesome. Consider our simple initial scenario of loading a file from the file system and streaming it to the client. This can be as simple as a code segment fileSystemStream.pipe(userSocket).<br />
<br />
You can pipe from a stream you can read from (Readable/Duplex/Transform) to a stream you can write to (Writable/Duplex/Transform). This function is called pipe because it mimics the behavior of the command line pipe operator, for example, cat file.txt | grep lol.<br />
<br />
The fs core module provides utility functions to create readable or writable streams from a file. Listing 5-36 is an example that streams a file from the file system to the user console.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-36. streams/2pipe/1basic.js
var fs = require('fs');

// Create readable stream
var readableStream = fs.createReadStream('./cool.txt');

// Pipe it to stdout
readableStream.pipe(process.stdout);
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>You can also chain multiple streams using pipe. For example, the code in Listing 5-37 creates a read stream from a file, pipes it through a zip transform stream, and then pipes it to a writable file stream. This creates a zip file on the file system.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-37. streams/2pipe/2chain.js
var fs = require('fs');
var gzip = require('zlib').createGzip();

var inp = fs.createReadStream('cool.txt');
var out = fs.createWriteStream('cool.txt.gz');

// Pipe chain
inp.pipe(gzip).pipe(out);
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Streams in Node.js are based on events. All that the pipe operation does is subscribe to the relevant events on the source and call the relevant functions on the destination. For most purposes, pipe is all that you need to know about as an API consumer, but it is worth knowing more details when you want to delve deeper into streams.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Consuming Readable Streams</h3>
      <p>We’ve said it many times already that streams work based on events. The most important event for a readable stream is 'readable'. This event is raised whenever there is new data to be read from a stream. Once inside the event handler, you can call the read function on the stream to read data from the stream. If this is the end of the stream, the read function returns null, as demonstrated in Listing 5-38.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-38. streams/3readable/basic.js
process.stdin.on('readable', function () {
    var buf = process.stdin.read();
    if (buf != null) {
        console.log('Got:');
        process.stdout.write(buf.toString());
    }
    else {
        console.log('Read complete!');
    }
});
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>A sample run of this code is shown in Listing 5-39, where we pipe data into process.stdin from the command line.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-39. Sample Run of streams/3readable/basic.js
$ echo 'foo bar bas' | node basic.js
Got:
'foo bar bas'
Read complete!
      </code>
      </pre>

      <h3 class="section-header">Writing to Writable Streams</h3>
      <p>To write to a stream, you simply call write to write some data. When you have finished writing (end of stream), you simply call end. You can also write some data using the end member function if you want, as shown in Listing 5-40.<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-40. streams/4writable/basic.js
var fs = require('fs');
var ws = fs.createWriteStream('message.txt');

ws.write('foo bar ');
ws.end('bas');
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>In this sample, we simply wrote foo bar bas to a writable file stream.<br />
</p>

      <h3 class="section-header">Creating Your Own Stream</h3>
      <p>Creating your own stream is very similar to how you create your own EventEmitter. For streams you inherit from the relevant base, stream class and implement a few base methods. This is detailed in Table 5-1.<br />
<br />
The inheritance mechanism is the same as we have seen before. That is, you call the base constructor from your class constructor and call utils.inherits after declaring you class.<br />
<br />
Table 5-1. Creating Your Own Custom Streams<br />
</p>

      <h4 class="section-header">Creating a Readable Stream</h4>
      <p>As stated, you simply inherit from Readable class. You implement the _read member in your class, which is called by the stream API internally when someone requests data to be read. If you have data that you want to be passed on (pushed), you call the inherited member function push passing in the data. If you call push(null), this signals the end of the read stream.<br />
<br />
Listing 5-41 is a simple example of a readable stream that returns 1-1000. If you run this, you will see all these numbers printed (as we pipe to stdout).<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-41. streams/5createReadable/counter.js
var Readable = require('stream').Readable;
var util = require('util');

function Counter() {
    Readable.call(this);
    this._max = 1000;
    this._index = 1;
}
util.inherits(Counter, Readable);

Counter.prototype._read = function () {
    var i = this._index++;
    if (i > this._max)
        this.push(null);
    else {
        var str = ' ' + i;
        this.push(str);
    }
};

// Usage, same as any other readable stream
var counter = new Counter();
counter.pipe(process.stdout);
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>As you can see, the underlying Readable class provides most of the stream logic for you.<br />
</p>

      <h4 class="section-header">Creating a Writable Stream</h4>
      <p>Creating your own writable stream class is similar to how we created a readable stream. You inherit from the Writable class and implement the _write method. The _write method is passed in a chunk that needs processing as its first argument.<br />
<br />
Listing 5-42 is a simple writable stream that logs to the console all the data passed in. In this example, we simply pipe from the readable file stream to this writeable stream (Logger).<br />
</p>

      <pre><code class="javascript">
// Listing 5-42. streams/6createWritable/logger.js
var Writable = require('stream').Writable;
var util = require('util');

function Logger() {
    Writable.call(this);
}
util.inherits(Logger, Writable);

Logger.prototype._write = function (chunk) {
    console.log(chunk.toString());
};

// Usage, same as any other Writable stream
var logger = new Logger();

var readStream = require('fs').createReadStream('message.txt');
readStream.pipe(logger);
      </code>
      </pre>
    
      <p>Again, for most purposes, the bulk of the functionality is handled internally by the Writable base class.<br />
</p>
